# Graphic Design

I’m not a dedicated graphic design, but I do like graphic design. I care. Mostly because I like things that look nice, and it bothers me when they don’t. A nicely designed UI/UX feels so, so good, whether it be a dynamic application or a static infographic.

I’ve always loved experimenting with fonts (*typefaces, hehe), and in recent years have come to appreciate colour a lot more too. Spacing is something I’m still tryna improve at.

Anyway, here you’ll find pages archiving some of the infographics (‘posters’, sure) I’ve created over the years. Yes, most of them were for school. They’re all made in Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 – the offline version, to be clear, because Office online is an anomination.
