### *McLaren S1 Formula*
Having the highest top speed in the entire game, surpassing even the Swift Arven, SSC Aero AXXR and Fantasy FXX-16V, the McLaren S1 Formula completely blows away the opposition. Its powerfully quick primary *and secondary acceleration allow it to easily reach and maintain its high top speed. The S1's turning capabilities are much higher than average, which is to be expected of a Formula One racecar; its drifting is also quite subpar as expected, which can let it down on sharper turns. Although losing little speed while drifting, this just so happens to be its downfall - it cannot turn sharply enough and often ends up going wide or wider than ideal. However, the S1 does have an interesting quirk in that it can turn *much sharper when turning to the maximum - but it loses a *lot of speed while doing so, therefore this should only be reserved for the sharpest of turns, such as 90Â° and circular turns. And keeping in fashion with Formula One racecars, the S1 has weak nitro and Overdrive - but its acceleration is already sufficiently fast anyway. Keep in mind that being a racecar, it is rather fragile, and compared to the other Class X cars, it is the most fragile of them all. In terms of ground and air performance, the S1 feels very 'grounded' despite being reasonably light - its aerodynamics are excellent too. With its heavy focus on sheer speed, the S1 Formula excels on straighter tracks, especially on long straight sections - this does provide an interesting dilemma of whether to utilize the starting straightaway on racetracks to maximize speed or pull over and exchange tires. Overall, it is safe to say that the McLaren S1 Formula, in the right hands, is certainly the king of the game, though not by a huge margin.

### *Ferrari Xezri Concept*
