Here is my public announcement  
Regarding the demotion and leave  
Of someone we probably all know  
Who goes by the name of InSanity  

Before we begin this rollercoaster  
Let's start with some important backstory  
I'll make it quick, but please do listen  
Because, well, it's obligatory  

InSanity joined way back in November  
Making him an Original Member  
He was there from the very start  
Guiding us from the bottom of his heart  

Back when Razz or Jazz was not a Discord expert  
And Chespin and Sup weren't here at all  
Vitrux was still active  
And the server was still small  

InSanity was there to help  
When all anyone could say was welp (fuck it)  
As such, he should be divinefully hailed  
As a godsend and legend, but of that we have failed  

The first thing you might think  
When I say his name  
Is "fuck you idiot  
You're so trash at the game"  

"Your jokes are crap
Your username is shit  
You're annoying as fuck  
Your memes make me cringe  
Leave me alone  
You fucking weirdo"  

Fair enough.  
He could be insane  
Swearing and insults  
An absolute pain  

But that's not all that he was  
That's just what most people saw  
Beneath the murky surface  
There lies much more  

It's not just because  
He was here from the start  
It's cuz he's helpful and dedicated  
And funny and smart  

He could be productive if need be  
A genius when times were tough  
Swooping in he save the day  
A saviour when things were rushed  

Whenever you needed someone to talk to  
He was always (somehow) online  
And if you weren't annoying and dumb  
He could actually be really kind  

But see, most of all  
He was a great friend  
He could be heartfelt and wholesome and helpful  
Someone on which you could always depend  

Yes, he blocked me, like, four fucking times  
And ghosted me for a while, but that didn't tear us apart  
We got past all the conflicts and fights  
And now, we're the best of friends and all that is past  

But none of us are perfect  
And neither is InSanity  
He had his flaws  
But, that's just humanity  

So I ask, don't ridicule and criticise him  
For all that he's done, and all that he's been  
Cuz if you really get to know him  
(And I'm not saying I completely have)
He's... super fun, and really not that mean.  

This is just my point of view, I don't really know about others  
Maybe your experiences are different, maybe they're the same  
But if he genuinely hates you and treats you like shit  
Well, I guess you only have yourself to blame.
