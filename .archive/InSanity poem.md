I wrote this poem for you  
But also for myself too  
I'd appreciate it if you could read it  
And take it to heart cause I mean it  

I wish it could go back to how it was before  
Cuz I really don't want this to go on anymore  
When did everything change  
When did you get all enraged  
Really, what is this all for?  

Let's go back to the times of the past  
Cuz it seems like everything's changed so frickin fast  
You may be insane  
And I may be a pain  
But I don't want this talk to be our last  

See, you're funny and smart and a pleasure to talk to  
And when no one's online there's always you  
I love you whole-heartedly as a friend  
And I don't want this friendship to end  

Those talks of RIVALS, I missed it  
And encoding SurvivalScripted  
Whether it's out of context quotes  
Or funny anecdotes  
You always left my spirits uplifted  

Why can't we go back to the fun  
Now it feels like everything's been undone  
I don't mind all the dirty shit  
The talk of anime girls and dicks  
Let's put down our rapiers and guns  

I don't know how to feel  
But I promise this is real  
From the bottom of my heart  
I don't want to be apart  

So InSanity, I plead...  
Please forgive me.
