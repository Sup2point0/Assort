#### What’s this?
[Synopsis](https://sup2point0.github.io/Assort/synopsis) will answer that!

#### How was the site built?
The footer of every page tells you! For further details, see [Synopsis](https://sup2point0.github.io/Assort/synopsis) again :P

#### How is there *so* much stuff?
This is like, everything from pretty much my entire life, so y’know. Yeah. It builds up.

Also, not everything in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort) is even deployed to this site version (yet), so there’s even more there :v

#### Can I use any of the content?
See [License](https://sup2point0.github.io/Assort/license).

#### Can I contribute?
I mean... *Assort* is for me. So nah. But thanks for the sentiment ;)

#### But I found a typo!
Ahhhh! Let me know in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort/issues) and I’ll be right onto fixing it.

#### Why do all of this?
What can I say, I just love creating content. The only thing that brings me more joy than writing things no one reads is having someone read something I wrote thinking no one would read.

#### How was *Assort* built?
Love, plenty of time, doses of passion, a touch of boredom, sprinkles of wonderlust, dreams, twinklings of ambition, and an overdose of love.

#### What does *Assort* mean?
Assort: *archaic* place in a group; classify.

Ayo, archaic?

#### What other questions could you ask?
Idk, people always manage to find new ones.

If you’ve got one that’s not here, feel free to drop it in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort/issues) ofc ;)
