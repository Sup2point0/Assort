There’s no privacy policy, because there’s literally no privacy concerns.

Literally none. No cookies, no identification, no ads.

For the developers, all this site uses is `localStorage` to keep your preferences saved – light/dark, navpane, that kinda stuff.

Sauce? I mean... it’s all open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort) anyway, so if you care that much, you could scour the code for any suspicious malicious deliciousness. Wait, what were we talking about again?

Anyhow, enjoy *Assort*!
