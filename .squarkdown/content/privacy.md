There’s no privacy policy, because Assort doesn’t collect any data. No cookies, no analytics, no identification.

For the developers, all this site uses is `localStorage` to keep your preferences saved – light/dark, accessibility, that kinda stuff. You can view it (and even alter or delete it) through **Application** » **Local Storage** in Developer Tools (inspect).

Sauce? I mean... it’s all open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort) anyway, so if you care that much, you could scour the code for any suspicious malicious deliciousness. Wait, what were we talking about again?

Anyhow, enjoy *Assort*!
