# Heavy Crown
Autumn 2022  

Time, time, and time again  
For far too many times have rulers been  
Corrupted by the poison of power  
And lost sight of their original dream

Abandoned goals once noble and worthy  
Forgotten promises once made  
As if just mere stepping stones used to climb  
And once there 'mediately cast away

Through the blurred lens of their myopic eye  
Do nought but flaunt ceremonial right  
They see not what is truly important  
But relish in their own apparent might

That will never be me.

For I shall live up to my promises  
Weed out who worms their way into the ring  
Stay true and loyal to myself and you  
And so I ask, allow me to be king.
