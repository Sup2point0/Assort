# Music

I never thought I’d be able to make my own music, but here I am. I’ve still got a long way – a long, long way — to go, but I’m really loving it. Check out what I’ve [created](tracks)!

## MuseScore
Installed this on my own laptop for music work during lockdown of Covid-19, and realised how incredible it was, for something entirely free. And now MuseScore 4!?

## GarageBand
I loved GarageBand as a kid, but the stuff I made on there wasn’t especially... presentable. Well, now I’ve returned to it with a lot more understanding and experience – and an iPad with an Apple Pencil (:P), which makes it *soo* much nicer – and y’know what, you can create some pretty awesome stuff on it.

Like MuseScore, it’s incredible for a free piece of software, and one that’s part of the default suite of iOS apps at that! Apple’s not perfect by any means, but I absolutely love them for this.
