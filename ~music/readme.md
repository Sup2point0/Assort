I love music.

Ok, anyone can say that, and I probably don’t love it as much as diploma-level musicians and prodigies or whatever. But it is absolutely an irreplaceable part of my life, and I love listening, playing and creating music. Like, I vibe (rhythmically and melodically) to songs, I (like to think I) appreciate well-made music, and I’m much more aware of music as a whole (compared to, say, a non-musician).

With that said, listening to and creating music are really quite different. So, we’ll split this directory up into a folder for [listening](listen/) to music and [creating](create/) music.
