My musical tastes have changed wildly over the years, but for the most part I think anything electronic is just really attractive to me.

I should immediately make clear that I don’t listen to pop music, like the kind you’d hear on the radio – altho the music is indeed really well-made and achieves its goals really quite well. Yeah no, I tend to be niche.

So, here we go!

## Antiquity – Electronic

### Discovering Music
I discovered I liked music – that is, noticed it existed and that I wanted to actively listen to it – while watching [.io games](~) videos on YouTube (especially by [iXPLODE](../../~writing/origins.md#Conformity)). I must’ve finally realised I could find links to the songs in the descriptions of videos, and I stumbled across Elektronomia, the first artist I grew attached to.
