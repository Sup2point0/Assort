      <p>One of my favourite indulgences is freely browsing Wikipedia. Maybe it’s down to my natural interest for anything and everything, but it’s kinda unreal how much I enjoy it, and how long I can go on for, just reading whatever interesting articles I come across.</p>
      <p>But Wikipedia is a wormhole, an endless one to go down.</p>
      <p>It all starts with the root page. The first page that I open up in a particular excursion, perhaps some research I’m doing, or a concept I’d like to find out more about. Say I’m learning about chemistry, and decide to search up <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand" rel="nofollow">ligand</a> on Wikipedia. Or programming, so I check out the page for <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" rel="nofollow">Hello, world!</a>.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of this demonstration, let’s go with a pretty versatile option – the Wikipedia page on <a href="">worldbuilding</a>, which looks like this.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=""><img src="" alt="Worldbuilding" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
      <p>Now within the page, are links. Loads and loads of them. The first one here is <a href="">fictional universe</a>, which looks pretty interesting – so I ctrl+click it, opening it up in the background, saved for later.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=""><img src="" alt="Fictional Universe" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
      <p>So I’ll go down the page, reading the sections that interest me (usually the entire page), and whenever I find a link that feels like it could lead to something interesting, I open it up. And this happens multiple times. By the end, this is what my tab bar looks like.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=""><img src="" alt="Tabs" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
      <p>Then once I’m done with this page, I’ll close it, and move on to all the other pages I’ve opened up in the background. Except for each of those, there’ll be more links. And in those linked pages, even more links.</p>
      <p>What happens then, is an endless chain of pages linking to more interesting pages – which is awesome and all, often I diverge way from the original topic, and find super interesting stuff I would never have found otherwise – but it never ends. Eventually I find myself with 20+ tabs open, wondering how in the world I got here, and how I’m gonna plough through all of these.</p>
      <p>It’s like bacteria reproducing, honestly. Each page will link to at least 1 other ‘child’ page, just like a bacterium splitting via binary fission. But rarely is that the case; most of the time it’s anywhere between 3~7 links, so the bacterium splits multiple times. The growth is explosive and ridiculously difficult to get under control. Only when I get down to an obscure stub article that can’t lead anywhere else is that route finally terminated.</p>
      <p>As an aside, let’s consider a different method – the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> method, where we build Chain Links and resolve them backwards. In this case, if I got to an interesting link within an article, I’d open up that page, and then once I’m done with that, close it and return to the original.</p>
      <p>The problem? While in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> nothing else can be chained while resolving a Chain Link, with Wikipedia that’s not the case at all. In other words, Chain Links in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> are literal chains, while with Wikipedia, it’s a supernatural branching tree. Oh, and while resolving Chain Links in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> is (fairly) straightforward (actually, on second thoughts, it’s not, it’s really not, but still), for Wikipedia it’s a nightmare, tracking where you got up to in an article and remembering the context.</p>
      <p>So, y’know what, I think the optimal solution is a mix of both. I will ‘collect’ the interesting links as I go through a page, but if I come across one that I only need a quick overview of to understand in the context, hovering over it to read its opening summary works just fine too – and then if it looks intriguing enough, I can save that too.</p>
      <p>Other than that, sometimes I just need to tell myself to stop, and stop opening more links.</p>
      <p>But that’s no fun, so actually I’ve now got ~20 Wikipedia pages open at all times in my browser, which just perpetually exist, sometimes shrinking, sometimes exploding, existing in happy kinda-stable equilibrium. It’s fine. I mean my device’s memory has other complaints but we can ignore those.</p>
      <p>And this, is the wormhole of Wikipedia.</p>
