<p>I remember when I first saw these cards all over <em>Master Duel</em> – this was just about when I was getting back into the game, so they were totally unfamiliar to me – and thinking, <em>’damn, cool names, cool art, cool cards’</em>. It was a wonderful kind of blissful ignorance.<sup><a href="#fn-bliss-feel" id="user-content-fnref-bliss-feel" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup> While I thought the cards were cool, I really didn’t like how the deck functioned at first. A very linear and efficient combo, just felt kinda scummy for such low effort.</p>
<p>As I’ve discovered the rest of the archetype though, and most importantly delved into its rich lore (courtesy of <a href="https://youtube.com/@GoldenNovaYugioh" rel="nofollow">Golden Nova Yu-Gi-Oh<sup>↗</sup></a>), I unknowingly came to love it. I still don’t play it, and don’t plan on playing it, but I absolutely adore the characters and art and the magnificent inter-weaving story. Can’t wait for part 2. I kinda hold an uncharged<sup><a href="#fn-uncharged" id="user-content-fnref-uncharged" data-footnote-ref="">2</a></sup> respect for its efficiency and resiliency (for me at least, it’s one of the quintessential modern decks), and I do like that its combos have become more diverse and non-linear with the addition of all the new cards. Also, Branded is a blast to duel against.<sup><a href="#fn-branded-duel" id="user-content-fnref-branded-duel" data-footnote-ref="">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Never have I ever hated an archetype as much as this, I don’t think. Purely from a design perspective, it’s way, too, overtuned – and while that may not directly translate into power, it certainly makes the cards appear frustratingly unfair (at least to me).</p>
