<p>A year ago, or just a little more<br>
It seems like a completely different world<br>
Created by Vitrux, the Times was born<br>
Hard to believe that it’s now one year old<br>
Four different accounts, four eras past<br>
Four dozen editions, and then some<br>
Generations of editors and staff<br>
It’s crazy to see just how far we’ve come<br>
So now has come the time to celebrate<br>
For what a wondrous journey this has been<br>
Although it’s just a tiny bit late<br>
Let’s all shout ‘Happy Anniversary!’<br>
And now that we’ve made it through a whole year<br>
Here’s to one more, let’s hope the end isn’t too near</p>
<br>
<p>(November 2021)</p>
