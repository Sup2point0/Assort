<p>When considering which filler text to utilize, there are a couple of important factors to consider, that will affect the effectiveness of the demonstration. This includes whether or not the text includes less common letters, a variety of words, both in spelling, length and semantics; these are all important to properly demonstrating a typeface, involving both its appearance and utility. The total length of the entire text should reflect the use of the font, such as with longer paragraphs having smaller font size.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that between attack speed and attack delay, which are in fact direct inverses of each other. Attack delay refers to the time delay between each attack, often excluding animations, and so the lower, the stronger (ignoring context and game-specific nuances). For example, consider 2 weapons with different cooldowns: 1 shall have a delay of 0.3s between each attack, while the other 0.6s. Evidently the weapon with 0.3s fires faster, and intuitively it follows that it fires twice as fast as the other. This leads nicely on to attack speed, which is generally the preferred metric. This describes the number of attacks over a given duration, often a second, and so is usually described in attacks per second. Note diving 1 by attack delay yields the attack speed – in other words, taking the reciprocal – as it essentially corresponds to the question of “how many times can I fit this cooldown delay into 1 second?” In this way, an interesting relationship between attack speed and delay is revealed: they are directly inversely proportional to each other, where k in xy = k is precisely 1 (given that their time units are equivalent). A slightly more confusing but nonetheless critical aspect to wrap our heads around, is that of increasing and decreasing attack rate. A linear increase in attack speed corresponds to an exponential decrease in attack delay, and vice versa. For this, consider decreasing attack delay from 1s to 0.9s, compared to decreasing from 0.2s to 0.1s. The latter, relatively, is a 50% drop, while the former is only 10%. Similarly, increasing from 1 attack per second to 2 is a significant 100% increase, while 10 to 11 is a mere 10%. Plotting these relationships onto a graph, with the x axis being increasing attack speed, we see that attack delay forms a reciprocal curve. Swapping the x axis for decreasing attack delay, attack speed will form an exponential curve. Hence, when considering the value of a particular upgrade, it is always essential to remember the relative increase in strength, as opposed to the absolute change.</p>
