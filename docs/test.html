<p>How do we start this one?<br>
Or what if this had no structure<br>
or form<br>
or rhyme<br>
or flow<br>
But we just<br>
let it be.<br>
This is no masterpiece, I’m sure<br>
But perhaps it’s something more<br>
When the rhyming couplets come naturally<br>
And we don’t go back and edit,<br>
Whatever’s written stays written.<br>
Like traditional pen-and-paper<br>
Simpler.<br>
There is less thought into this, no doubt<br>
But there is more thought it here, <em>all</em> thoughts<br>
Whatever comes to mind ~ down<br>
And imperfections might linger<br>
if only to remind a future descendant of prior gaps<br>
Maybe they’ll be the one to fill it.<br>
Are these even filled with deeper meaning?<br>
Why do I write them?<br>
An escape<br>
A medium<br>
for expression, if I even needed that<br>
Every wackoff piece like this<br>
dilutes the purity of this directory<br>
yet<br>
who cares.<br>
I care, but –<br>
maybe this is what I need.<br>
How can I have so many thoughts<br>
cataclysmically reverberating within this space<br>
Demanding to be voiced and recorded<br>
Recced and docced, as I now say<br>
so much thought<br>
for meaning beyond<br>
This barely classes as a poem.<br>
We shall leave it as a footnote.<br>
One final rhyming couplet, tick–<br>
That ought to do the trick.</p>
