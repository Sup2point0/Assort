<p>Words are knives.<br>
They mercilessly slice apart your skin<br>
And deep into the flesh within<br>
In searing agony they carve<br>
Two hundred thousand bloody scars<br>
We carry through our lives.</p>
<p>Words are spears.<br>
They pierce the heart to cut the soul<br>
And in their wake an aching hole<br>
It takes all of your life to seal<br>
The marks they leave that never heal<br>
Frozen dry by tears.</p>
<p>Words are pain.<br>
The kind that grows in cold neglect<br>
Within the heat of rage should we forget<br>
The consequences of our words<br>
of everlasting shame and hurt<br>
Words are not a game.</p>
