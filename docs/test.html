<p>Quasi-sarcastive ironicity,<br>
Lopsided eyes of shining intellect,<br>
Shared loves, interests, affinitys,<br>
How in xenique can he be so perfect.<br>
No one has ever warmed my heart like so,<br>
Indulged my quirks, looked past my flaws,<br>
When I’m with him I can pour out my soul,<br>
He’s everything a friend could be and more.<br>
I think by now I’ve truly given in,<br>
No matter who else I find in the world,<br>
Could never understand me quite like him,<br>
If only in some life he were a girl.<br>
Why should I open up to someone new?<br>
Should lower my expectations a few.</p>
