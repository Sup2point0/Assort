<p>There,<br>
A summer past, a summer been;<br>
Spent, well spent, aware,<br>
Inching closer to those furtive dreams;<br>
Where to next?</p>
<p>I think, I wonder,<br>
The path ahead lies uncertain, trepid;<br>
Sometime, somewhere,<br>
As they say, over yonder;<br>
Murky in its shallow depths,<br>
Blurry in its promise kept,<br>
The next destination in a lifetime epic.</p>
<p>Bit, by bit,<br>
I hack away;<br>
Brazenly, assuredly,<br>
Strays<br>
of untouched blades,<br>
Supple and brilliant in their aestival green,<br>
Roughened by the vies of nature.</p>
<p>Assorted landmarks<br>
to pave the way,<br>
Into an unknown future,<br>
Slit through with one tepid ray;<br>
Awaiting,<br>
Someone, something,<br>
Right there for the taking.</p>
<p>Just a stretch of timea away,<br>
An age of brighter days,<br>
Perhaps it was not meant to be.</p>
<br>
<p>(Summer 2022)</p>
