<p>Quantity is rough.<br>
How do these people write so much<br>
in such<br>
a tiny space of time<br>
Their minds<br>
must be ever taut<br>
with unrelenting thought<br>
to continue, press on, drive<br>
ahead, their fingers fly and strive<br>
to write<br>
and right! It’s right,<br>
all stuff of value,<br>
mildly waffle, sure, but indeed all true<br>
Perhaps unsophisticated and verbose<br>
and overly developed prose<br>
No commas, punctuation<br>
and way too complex sentence construction,<br>
Yet comprehensive,<br>
certainly extensive,<br>
Covering all that needs to be said,<br>
while coming across as very well read,<br>
And even if that may not be the case<br>
it’s them who win the race<br>
I think, at least,<br>
or maybe my prowess has just decreased<br>
and I’m delusional<br>
My mind has gone diagonal<br>
They say don’t sell<br>
yourself short, but well<br>
I just can’t write, or speak,<br>
or read, or leak<br>
ideas that quick<br>
or think<br>
ahead by 20 paragraphs<br>
If only I could write just half<br>
as fast as I could type<br>
then life<br>
would suck less<br>
Ah, this is a mess.</p>
