<p>You do not understand how much I enjoy making lists, or just how many I’ve created.</p>
<p>The number I have devyzed in my cerebral cortex, but haven’t written down, is a number you cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>I could list all the lists here, but I won’t do that.</p>
<p>On second thoughts...</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
