<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Discipline</h2><a id="user-content-discipline" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Discipline" href="#discipline"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Avoid shouting.</h3><a id="user-content-avoid-shouting" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Avoid shouting." href="#avoid-shouting"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Overuse diminishes effectiveness. Shouting in every reprimand defeats the purpose. It only serves to exacerbate negative emotions and instil fear. One day they’ll shout back. And shouting battles are pointless.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not swear or display violence.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-swear-or-display-violence" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not swear or display violence." href="#do-not-swear-or-display-violence"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>This is never the way, and only reflects poorly on yourself. Your lack of self-control, over many occurrences, will teach them that this is normal. Rather than instilling fear and hatred, using compassion and understanding to show them why something was wrong is so much more effective and long-lasting.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not spam rhetorical questions.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-spam-rhetorical-questions" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not spam rhetorical questions." href="#do-not-spam-rhetorical-questions"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>In a reprimand they often have a terrible tone. They only serve to make them feel worse, and question themselves.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not pointlessly repeat yourself.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-pointlessly-repeat-yourself" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not pointlessly repeat yourself." href="#do-not-pointlessly-repeat-yourself"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Repetition reinforces, but repeated repetition reduces. If they get it, they get it, and repeating will not make it any firmer, just accelerate zoning out.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not stray from your point.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-stray-from-your-point" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not stray from your point." href="#do-not-stray-from-your-point"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>They can only absorb so much information. Littering a reprimand with unrelated or irrelevant points detracts from its effectiveness and undermines the important arguments.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not say things you don’t truly mean.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-say-things-you-dont-truly-mean" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not say things you don’t truly mean." href="#do-not-say-things-you-dont-truly-mean"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Vicious words let loose in the heat of a reprimand cause long-lasting hurt and shame. Sometimes, they cannot be taken back. Repeated exposure risks alienation. Personal attacks leveraging insecurities are unacceptable.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not be a hypocrite.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-be-a-hypocrite" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not be a hypocrite." href="#do-not-be-a-hypocrite"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>You want change? You set an example first. Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not mock anyone.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-mock-anyone" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not mock anyone." href="#do-not-mock-anyone"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Childish.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not make permanent decisions over temporary feelings.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-make-permanent-decisions-over-temporary-feelings" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not make permanent decisions over temporary feelings." href="#do-not-make-permanent-decisions-over-temporary-feelings"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Should you then retract those decisions, you lose credibility and respect. Empty threats, while intimidating at first, quickly lose significance and insinuate incompetency.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not speak in absolutes.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-speak-in-absolutes" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not speak in absolutes." href="#do-not-speak-in-absolutes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Absolute points intimidate but are almost never true. Absolute threats intimidate at first but are almost never followed through. Speaking in absolutes reflects narrow thinking, losing you respect and credibility.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Let them speak.</h3><a id="user-content-let-them-speak" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Let them speak." href="#let-them-speak"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>There is nothing worse than being helplessly silenced, unable to fight back for yourself. If they feel the need to, let them raise a point.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not drag it long for longer than necessary.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-drag-it-long-for-longer-than-necessary" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not drag it long for longer than necessary." href="#do-not-drag-it-long-for-longer-than-necessary"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>They can only focus for so long. The longer you drag it on for, the less they’ll absorb and remember. It’s also an abject waste of time.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Do not overdo it.</h3><a id="user-content-do-not-overdo-it" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Do not overdo it." href="#do-not-overdo-it"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Overuse diminishes effectiveness. Do not let reprimands become the norm. Once they stop arguing back, you’ve broken them. Once they automatically tune you out, you’ve lost them.</p>
