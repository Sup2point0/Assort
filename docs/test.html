<p>There are few feelings worse than burnout.<br>
When your heart once filled with wonder and delight<br>
Now lies extinguished, ephemerally alight;<br>
Hands frozen dry, ears closed, eyes dim<br>
Before you even knew the cold seeped in.<br>
You drift, wander, living on sparks<br>
To burn you inside until you’re scarred.<br>
When there was no dark you thought the light would never run out<br>
But now night falls and you see the shadows of doubt.<br>
What happened to being driven?<br>
What happened to having love?<br>
You don’t train for the shots you’re given<br>
And won’t get up without a nudge.<br>
As <em>if</em> more time will erase the stains<br>
Of stagnation, complacence which still remain;<br>
Regret, remorse, relapse, you’ve utterly cursed<br>
yourself with everything, everywhere and so much worse;<br>
Your hear those whispers in the dark of your mind.<br>
Perhaps for the first time in your life<br>
You are understanding what it means to feel fear.<br>
Now the bubble has burst and I can hear<br>
The looming weight of the world,<br>
Eternally above<br>
And it’s soul-crushing<br>
Mind-tearing,<br>
Heart-burning.<br>
When did we grow up?</p>
