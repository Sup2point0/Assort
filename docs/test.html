<p>Time, time, and time again<br>
For far too many times have rulers been<br>
Corrupted by the poison of power<br>
And lost sight of their original dream</p>
<p>Abandoned goals once noble and worthy<br>
Forgotten promises once made<br>
As if just mere stepping stones used to climb<br>
And once there â€™mediately cast away</p>
<p>Through the blurred lens of their myopic eye<br>
Do nought but flaunt ceremonial right<br>
They see not what is truly important<br>
But relish in their own apparent might</p>
<p>That will never be me.</p>
<p>For I shall live up to my promises<br>
Weed out who worms their way into the ring<br>
Stay true and loyal to myself and you<br>
And so I ask, allow me to be king.</p>
<br>
