<p>There comes a moment in everyone’s mind<br>
When you look back and see all that is past,<br>
Reflect on memories and different times<br>
And feel like they’re slipping out of your grasp;</p>
<p>Those blissful days of naive hopes and dreams,<br>
Unknowingly creating precious<br>
memories to last for years;<br>
Not all that long ago it sometimes seems,<br>
It’s almost like just yesterday<br>
That we were standing just right here.</p>
<p>Often the past seems better than the now<br>
The good ol’ days when everything was pure,<br>
Without everything to worry about<br>
And the novel facet still held allure;</p>
<p>With desperation swim against the tide,<br>
Like aves struggling to lift, strained down<br>
by damp wings tangled in a net;<br>
It’s that funny feeling you get inside,<br>
Helpless, drowning, unreal, gone<br>
They told you that your path was set.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is just simply how we are,<br>
And even the closest of echoes can feel far.</p>
