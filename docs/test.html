<p>There are some things that I find <em>incredibly</em>, <em>abjectly</em> dumb in science, that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.</p>

<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">This convention of separating quantity and units with a slash</h3><a id="user-content-this-convention-of-separating-quantity-and-units-with-a-slash" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: This convention of separating quantity and units with a slash" href="#this-convention-of-separating-quantity-and-units-with-a-slash"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>I never understand why this is the preferred notation, when slash so definitively represents division. In no way are you <em>dividing</em> the quantity by the unit, so why slash? A pipe sign, backslash or even colon would be so much better. Or, just be normal, and use brackets!</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Magnitude scale of stellar brightness</h3><a id="user-content-magnitude-scale-of-stellar-brightness" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Magnitude scale of stellar brightness" href="#magnitude-scale-of-stellar-brightness"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Who the actual flip decided a reverse scale was a good idea. Cuz it is absolutely not. I mean, I just don’t see why it’s necessary, at all. There’s absolutely no reason for smaller values to be brighter, and all it does is make the scale more confusing and unintuitive. Just use a logarithmic scale for lumens, rather than creating a whole new unitless and pointless scale.</p>
