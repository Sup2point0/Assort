<p>PowerPoint is <em>so</em> awesome. But like anything, there’s still plenty of room for improvement, and there are loads of features I’d love to see!</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Features I’d Love in PowerPoint</h2><a id="user-content-features-id-love-in-powerpoint" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Features I’d Love in PowerPoint" href="#features-id-love-in-powerpoint"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Side scroll</h3><a id="user-content-side-scroll" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Side scroll" href="#side-scroll"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>It still confuzzles me how this isn’t a feature yet, when it’s so standard across all other applications, and is one of the most useful tools for navigation. <code>shift</code> + <code>scroll</code> is such a convenient and efficient way of moving around when zoomed in – I have plenty of experience from coding in Scratch – and it’s super disruptive to have to carefully move your house to drag the horizontal scroll bar.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Text highlight</h3><a id="user-content-text-highlight" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Text highlight" href="#text-highlight"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
