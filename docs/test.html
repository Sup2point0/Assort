That’s exactly what Herald of Mirage Lights does, grabbing back not 1, but <em>2</em> Ritual cards – how awesome is that!

<p>The dream endboard consists of White Zoa, Amorphactor Pain, Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon, Elder Entity.</p>
<p>White Zoa needs 3 cards to Ritual Summon – itself, Dogmatikabre, and a Draconids or Quadrantids in Hand to Tribute (or we could have a Lv8 Ritual and banish an Arc Light from the Grave, that works too). Regardless, it’s quite a lot to ask, and while it has stellar protection and a devastyzing effect, it’s probably not enough to hold up on its own – which means we can’t just abandon the Drytron side of things. So, I’ll only bring it out if I can still Ritual Summon other Ritual Monsters with Meteonis Drytron.</p>
<p>Luckily, Drytron’s got... wouldn’t say plenty, but definitely enough cards to search out all the Ritual Spells and Monsters we need. Nadir Servant is great for searching any missing piece we need, and if we go second Dogmatikatrix can grab both White Zoa and Dogmatikabre all in one go, or even another copy of itself if we’ve already got one of those.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Strengths</h3><a id="user-content-strengths" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Strengths" href="#strengths"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Drytron is definitely strong. It’s fallen behind the meta, sure, but it can still <em>do</em> things, and is plenty powerful if left unchecked. The archetype is by no means ‘grindy’, but grinds decently well – cycling the modules each turn for virtually no cost, and gaining card advantage through Drytron Alpha and Delta.</p>
<p>Due to the way it’s structured, Drytron has a few niche advantages. The effects of our modules don’t activate on the field, and their search is part of resolution, which means we can play under Skill Drain and other effects that relate to the field. Of course, the Rituals we’re aiming to end on won’t work, but luckily their high ATK means generally we can win through plain beatdown. We also don’t rely on Summoning from the Extra Deck too much, so while a lock or floodgate does hurt a bit, it doesn’t hurt anywhere as much as with other decks. Funniest of all of course, is how we benefit from burying from the Extra Deck – almost half of our Extra Deck is very useful when sent to the Grave.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Weaknesses</h3><a id="user-content-weaknesses" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Weaknesses" href="#weaknesses"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>As strong as it can be, Drytron is chock-full of weaknesses. Of course, the most pressing is consistency – unlike most other archetypes with 1-card starters, we need at least 2 Drytron modules to actually combo. And being a Ritual deck, we need to accumulate so many different cards to be able to even bring out any kind of boss Monster, so any negated search could be combo-ending. Don’t forget that all the effort is so resource-intensive that we’re often left with an empty hand after dropping everything we can, so a comeback in turn 3 too often relies on Heart of the Cards. Drytron can indeed have a pretty high ceiling, but do remember that we’re hard capped by 2 or 3 Ritual Summons each turn (and really only 1 in late game), and this requires having an opening hand with pretty much every card being live.</p>
<p>What hurts most, though, is that it’s vulnerable to almost every form of interruption. Handtrap-wise when going fist, you’ve got Ash Blossom and Ghost Belle negating the modules, Infinite Impermanence, Effect Veiler and even Ghost Ogre choking Mu Beta Fafnir, and of course Maxx C and Droll &amp; Lock Bird which are utter pain. Don’t even mention Bystials. Any grave disruption or floodgate, of which there is plenty – Called By The Grave, Ishizu shufflers, Abyss Dweller – totally kills the deck.</p>

<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Adamancipator</h3><a id="user-content-adamancipator" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Adamancipator" href="#adamancipator"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Blue-Eyes</h3><a id="user-content-blue-eyes" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Blue-Eyes" href="#blue-eyes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon is such a pain. Luckily, Draconids can’t be targeted by it, and has excellent removal in case the opponent has a higher ATK Monster. Ironically, the best weapon against them is their own ace Monster – Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Branded Despia</h3><a id="user-content-branded-despia" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Branded Despia" href="#branded-despia"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>This is actually so fun to play against, even if I do end up losing most of the time. Since its speciality is removal and doesn’t have negates at all, it presents a far more interesting challenge to overcome – many of my most exhilaryzing and memorable duels have been against Branded Despia. I love playing against duelists who really <em>know</em> the deck and don’t just play it cuz meta. Especially those who take it further and stretch its capabilitys, like Fusion Summoning twice in one Chain Link with Lubellion and Branded in Red.</p>
<p>Amorphactor Pain is my greatest weapon against them, but even then they can easily battle over it, and if I want to dismantle their board, Mirrorjade presents a difficult challenge to remove.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Bystial</h3><a id="user-content-bystial" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Bystial" href="#bystial"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Well, I’ma head out.</p>
<p>Yeah no, Bystial totally kills Drytron.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Dark Magician</h3><a id="user-content-dark-magician" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Dark Magician" href="#dark-magician"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Its only real interruption is the banish from Dark Magical Circle, which could be critical if we’ve got a weak hand, but is usually easy to overcome. Quadrantids is lethal against Dark Magician, since they can’t recover their Spell/Traps, and if they’ve activyzen Eternal Soul then they just end up nuking their own field.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Dinomorphia</h3><a id="user-content-dinomorphia" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Dinomorphia" href="#dinomorphia"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Dinomorphia’s pretty powerful at control, which Drytron tends to struggle against. Luckily while <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dinomorphia_Rexterm" rel="nofollow">Rexterm</a>’s ATK-modifying effect neutralises our Battle Phase, which will be our main way to deal with their Monsters, it doesn’t stop our modules from activating their effects since they don’t activate on the field. If we manage to get Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon on the field, they’re royally screwed. If we get an Amorphactor Pain with that too? Yeah, that’s gonna be rough. The only issue is stopping the opponent from just running over them.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Dogmatika</h3><a id="user-content-dogmatika" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Dogmatika" href="#dogmatika"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Haha, I’m afraid you just milled my 3 ARC LIGHTS – yeah, the mirror match is hilarious if they blindly mill my Extra Deck.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Eldlich</h3><a id="user-content-eldlich" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Eldlich" href="#eldlich"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Again, Chaos MAX Dragon. Can be a challenge to play against sometimes if they manage to snipe Meteonis Drytron in the Grave with Huaquero.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Floowandereeze</h3><a id="user-content-floowandereeze" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Floowandereeze" href="#floowandereeze"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>What a pain to play against.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Kashtira</h3><a id="user-content-kashtira" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Kashtira" href="#kashtira"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Aside from it being a horribly generic, efficient, vicious deck, Kashtira actually can’t handle targeting protection, and it can’t go over 3000 ATK, making Chaos MAX Dragon a fantastic weapon against them... if I can actually bring it out in the first place, what with all my Zones locked.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Labrynth</h3><a id="user-content-labrynth" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Labrynth" href="#labrynth"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon insta-win. Labrynth can’t handle targeting and destruction protection or that 4000 ATK, unless they bring out Skill Drain. Then we’re screwed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they trigger Waking the Dragon and we drop Ultimate Falcon on them, which is a definitive insta-win.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Marincess</h3><a id="user-content-marincess" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Marincess" href="#marincess"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>This shouldn’t be that hard to beat, but it is. Y’know what, returning to the original Ritual Monsters works wonderfully – Draconids and Quadrantids keep pressure on them by clearing their Spell/Traps each turn, and Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon really hurts since they combo so much.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Mathmech</h3><a id="user-content-mathmech" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Mathmech" href="#mathmech"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>I also play Mathmech myself, so I’m really familiar with how it works. And it can be really dangerous if we’re uncareful. Luckily skipping their Main Phase 1 with Amorphactor Pain neutralyzes the threat of an OTK, and if they don’t read and overlay into Alembertian or Laplacian while it’s on the field then things will be much more difficult for them.</p>
<p>If they go first and drop Superfactorial early, then counterplay is really quite difficult with the resource rip and negate. Draconids is probably the most effective here, to remove materials before they can Synchro into Final Sigma or Link into Accesscode.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Pendulum Magician</h3><a id="user-content-pendulum-magician" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Pendulum Magician" href="#pendulum-magician"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Never did I think I would hate such a cool deck (since I absolutely loved Yuya’s deck in Arc-V), but the endboards it cryzes are really, really toxic, and literally none of the cards are actually archetypical. Apollousa is enough to kill Drytron, but a Baronne de Fleur, Hope Harbinger, Borreload Savage Dragon, <em>and</em> Time Pendulumgraph too? Even if I draw Forbidden Droplet, it’ll cripple my Hand, and I don’t run Dark Ruler No More anymore.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Runick</h3><a id="user-content-runick" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Runick" href="#runick"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Honestly makes me want to crawl up and die. Whenever I face this, the race is on to grab Chaos MAX Dragon before they banish it, since just like with Labrynth, it’s an insta-win. It feels <em>soo</em> good crashing into a Hugin to deal perfectly 8000 damage. Unless they have Skill Drain... and they probably do. In which case, Quadrantids is our only good option, since whenever they destroy it it’ll bring back more Drytrons, hopefully to attack directly. Unless they have There Can Be Only One. Oh my days. What an absolute pain. And Dimensional Fissure. ALL the floodgates.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Sky Striker</h3><a id="user-content-sky-striker" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Sky Striker" href="#sky-striker"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>It’s beyond me how this deck even manages to put up a fight – maybe they just always catch me on a subpar hand.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Spright</h3><a id="user-content-spright" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Spright" href="#spright"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Well, this is really tough to beat. Since everything in Drytron is an activyzen effect, negates really hurt, and Spright is full of them. Amorphactor Pain can’t keep them at bay, and Chaos MAX Dragon falls to Spright Double Cross or a boosted Gigantic Spright.</p>
<p>If I want to win, I have to play as viciously as I can, which means not letting Spright play at all. Currently the best strategic I’ve found is to clear their field, which means they can’t use their innate Special Summons. Hitting their Normal Summon with Meteor Shower or Draconids kills them entirely, unless they have Starter. If they start with Starter we’re basically screwed, unless they Summon Gigantic with nothing else on the field, in which case hitting that with Draconids clears their field.</p>
<p>If it’s Runick Spright, then there’s very little hope, what with the insane advantage Fountain generyzes and the free Lv2 Special Summons that we just can’t stop.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Swordsoul</h3><a id="user-content-swordsoul" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Swordsoul" href="#swordsoul"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Swordsoul and Swordsoul Tenyi, unlike Branded Despia, are such a pain to play against. Which is weird, since both decks feature single-card opening combos and tech in other Monsters of their Summoning tecnique – and I even find Synchro Monsters cooler than Fusion Monsters. I suppose it’s because Swordsoul is so braindead to play, and provides such easy access to high-Level Synchro Monsters that would otherwise be much more difficult to Summon.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Tearlaments</h3><a id="user-content-tearlaments" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Tearlaments" href="#tearlaments"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Tearlaments is fine. No really, it dies to Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon or a turn one Amorphactor Pain. Ofc, <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Kaleido-Heart" rel="nofollow">Kaleido-Heart</a> and <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Rulkallos" rel="nofollow">Rulkallos</a> have some pretty wicked effects – almost all effects of our Drytron cards involve Special Summoning, and we each module to be in circulation – but if we manage to pull through, we can certainly take them down.</p>
<p>What’s isn’t fine tho, are the non-<em>Tearlaments</em> cards. Oh man, those are vicious. Ishizu, just like Bystial, totally kills Drytron, and does an even harsher job of it in the late-game, cleansing all of our modules right out of the Grave. And with Drytron’s playstyle, we’ll just be triggering <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Kelbek_the_Ancient_Vanguard" rel="nofollow">Kelbek</a>’s trigger effect right for them. And if they’ve come prepared, <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Underworld_Goddess_of_the_Closed_World" rel="nofollow">Underworld Goddess</a> is the easy out to Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon that’ll hurt us when trying to comeback too. Oh, and <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Abyss_Dweller" rel="nofollow">Abyss Dweller</a>? Just no.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">The Weather</h3><a id="user-content-the-weather" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: The Weather" href="#the-weather"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The Weather is strangely terrifying to play against, since it has incredible grind game that Drytron happens to have difficulty countering. In particular, it’s their Monsters banishing themselves as cost, and the protection and recovery for their Spell/Traps, that makes them so resilient. We don’t have any real counter to their strategy, and anything I try to bring out just dies to the <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Weather_Thundery_Canvas" rel="nofollow">Thundery Canvas</a>. Really, our best shot is to try and OTK with Lyrilusc – Assembled Nightingale and White Relic of Dogmatika, but that’s not always the easiest to pull off.</p>

<p>I:P Masquerena makes no difference for Drytron, as none of our effects involve destruction anyway. It’s the battle invulnerability that’s the most problematic, since we do often rely on our naturally high ATK to take out the opponent’s ace Monsters. So, Shinobaron Peacock is our only non-targeting non-destructive removal option – which sounds bad, but at least it’s searchable. Otherwise, we’d have to rely on drawing Forbidden Droplet or, heaven forbid, triggering Nibiru.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element"><a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Apollousa,_Bow_of_the_Goddess" rel="nofollow">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></h3><a id="user-content-apollousa-bow-of-the-goddess" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess" href="#apollousa-bow-of-the-goddess"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Drytron’s worst nightmare. Seriously. If we don’t draw a Spell/Trap out to this (or have everything necessary for a Ritual Summon in hand – that’s rare), we’re royally screwed. The issue, you see, is that Drytron cannot simply tank the negates or beat over it, because we rely exclusively on Special Summons, and can’t Special Summon without activating Monster effects. The feeling of having all your modules negated... man, it’s rough. The worst part? Often, Apolloussa is just one of our worries, cuz the opponent will have other interruptions or bodies for us to deal with.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’d love to reliably have Diviner for Lv7 Synchro Monsters, but I just don’t feel good playing Benten – I don’t really want to spend a Ritual search on it, using it feels like degeneracy, and above all I just don’t like its art... at all.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Why Dogmatikabre instead of Dogmatikalamity?</h3><a id="user-content-why-dogmatikabre-instead-of-dogmatikalamity" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Why Dogmatikabre instead of Dogmatikalamity?" href="#why-dogmatikabre-instead-of-dogmatikalamity"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Sure, Dogmatikalamity lets you Tribute straight from the Extra Deck, but it has 3 major downsides – it can’t Ritual Summon from the Grave, it can’t be searched by Pre-Preparation of Rites, and it locks you out of the Extra Deck.</p>
<p>Being able to revive from the Grave is huge, since it means we don’t need to keep the Dogmatika Ritual Monsters in Hand, and can Tribute them for Drytrons. Even if White Zoa being ripped from our Hand or Deck, we can still bring it back; we can even search it ourselves with Foolish Burial, if needed. It’s just far more flexible and versatile in general, particularly in late game, where Dogmatikalamity would otherwise be dead draw.</p>
<p>Locking us out of the Extra Deck doesn’t matter too much, since we could just drop White Zoa at the end of our combo anyway; but if we have Dogmatikatrix, bringing out a Dogmatika Ritual Monster as soon as possible means we’d be able to see what our opponent is playing, and setup an endboard accordingly, or if we’re lacking cards we need, send an Arc Light from our Extra Deck for a clutch search.</p>
<p>And of course, being searchable by Pre-Preparation of Rites is nice, freeing up our Zeta to search for Meteonis Drytron.</p>
