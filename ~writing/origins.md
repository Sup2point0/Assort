## ABSTRACT

> Many a times in the past have people, both those I have met online and those I know in real life, inquired into the origins behind my username `Sup#2.0`. However, for years the answer has been “oh, there’s *so* much lore behind it” [sic], or I have resorted to giving a quick (and often inconsistently incomplete) rundown, which leaves much to be desired, if only on my end. This will seek to remedy that. We will take a deep dive into the lore, reasoning and rationale behind the username of Sup#2.0 and its derivatives, analyse its evolution, structure and aptness, and finally consider various potential alternatives.

## FOREWORD

*This is perhaps a rather confused piece of writing, both in style and purpose; whether this is intentional or not shall, as per tradition, be left as an exercise to the reader. I’m sure there is plenty of profound meaning and allegory intwined here amidst the ambience and quasi-sarcastive ironicity, but as the supposed writer I’m afraid I could not tell you – it is up to you what you make of it. Hopefully this brief introduction will have only confused you further and unsettled any doubts still plaguing your mind. Enjoy.*

## INTRODUCTION

Across the various sites and services of the internet, users are given the option to create their own ‘username’, a pseudonym much like our real names that will represent that person online. Whether this must be unique, or if it can be modified once set, depends on the platform in question. However, often in the interest of creating an online ‘identity’ or ‘persona’ – especially for those involved in the content creation, such as music artists, livestreamers, YouTubers, etc. – individuals will decide upon a username and stick to it across platforms.


<br>


## STRUCTURE AND STYLE IN USERNAMES

> TLDR; usernames are incredibly significant, being the main thing that defines us online, and unimaginably influencing others’ perception of us. There are a number of distinct styles of usernames that have emerged, which we will take into consideration when analysing `Sup#2.0` later on.

### Capitalisation

| capitalisation | examples | critera | analysis |
| :------------- | :------- | :------ | :------- |
| lower | `soup`, `soupysoup` | All letters are lowercase. |
| initial | `Soup`, `Soupysoup` | First letter is capitalised. |
| title |`SoupySoup` | Every distinct word is capitalised. |
| camel | `soupySoup` | Every word is capitalised, except the first. |
| upper | `SOUP`, `SOUPYSOUP` | All letters are uppercase. | Loud, bold. Dependent on word length and choice. (Compare `ASH` and `HYPEREXPLOSION`) |
| dynamic | `sOUP`, `sOuP`, `SoupYsouP` | Varying capitalisation, though may follow a pattern. |

## CLOSURE

I am incredibly lucky to have found a username that so perfectly encapsulates me, and that I love wholeheartedly even decades since its conception.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Written, researched and recalled by Sup#2.0 ([@Sup2point0](https://github.com/Sup2point0)), November 2023 – ? 2024.

I would like to extend my gratitude towards the following:

- The creators of [*diep.io*](https://diep.io).
- My primary school friends who introduced me to *diep.io*.
- Everyone who asked me where my username came from. Your constant reminding was what drove me to embark upon and actually complete this ridiculous endeavour.
- That one player I met called ‘Sup’. None of this would’ve been possible without you. If you even exist.
- Childhood me. You were ahead of your time, truly. I’m unbelievably lucky to have grown from you.


<br>


## FINAL THOUGHTS

`2023/11/18` I started writing this at a really terrible time.  
`2023/11/23` Now the time is good. We’re gonna finish this.  
`2023/11/24` Damn, this just got big.  
`2023/11/25` Oh no, I just realised I could talk about my profile picture too... I think we’ll leave that for another time 0.o
