## ABSTRACT

> Many a times in the past have people, both those I have met online and those I know in real life, inquired into the origins behind my username `Sup#2.0`. However, for years the answer has been “oh, there’s *so* much lore behind it” [sic], or I have resorted to giving a quick (and often inconsistently incomplete) rundown, which leaves much to be desired, if only on my end. This will seek to remedy that. We will take a deep dive into the lore, reasoning and rationale behind the username of Sup#2.0 and its derivatives, analyse its evolution, structure and aptness, and finally consider various potential alternatives.

## FOREWORD

*This is perhaps a rather confused piece of writing, both in style and purpose; whether this is intentional or not shall, as per tradition, be left as an exercise to the reader. I’m sure there is plenty of profound meaning and allegory intwined here amidst the ambience and quasi-sarcastive ironicity, but as the supposed writer I’m afraid I could not tell you – it is up to you what you make of it. Hopefully this brief introduction will have only confused you further and unsettled any doubts still plaguing your mind. Enjoy.*

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Written, researched and recalled by Sup#2.0 ([@Sup2point0](https://github.com/Sup2point0)), November 2023 – ? 2024.

I would like to extend my gratitude towards the following:

- The creators of [*diep.io*](https://diep.io).
- My primary school friends who introduced me to *diep.io*.
- Everyone who asked me where my username came from. Your constant reminding was what drove me to embark upon and actually complete this ridiculous endeavour.
- That one player I met called ‘Sup’. None of this would’ve been possible without you. If you even exist.


<br>


## FINAL THOUGHTS

`2023/11/23` Now the time is good. We’re gonna finish this.
