- Syntax really doesn’t matter as much as semantics, and semantics really doesn’t matter as much as function. But that does *not* in any way mean they’re not still important.
- Software entropy is REAL

- Longer identifiers are an acceptable evil given in lieu of the added clarity they can provide.
