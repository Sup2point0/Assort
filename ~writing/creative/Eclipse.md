# Eclipse
<!-- #QUARK live! -->

It had already fallen dark. The hazy silhouettes of trees obscured the skyline, which had shifted into a brilliant gradient of deep blue to gold. The slightest remnant of the fading sun peeked out from over the horizon, glinting in the droplets of water clinging onto the wet grass, like a thousand little golden eyes watching the day fade away. The grass parted for the soft intruder, a faint rustle stroking the silence like a night-time lullaby. Some drops fell, shaken from their drowsy half-sleep; others clung on, excited for a new journey. Soft patters dotted the darkness.  
&emsp; Soon, another golden glint emerged in the eyes of the droplets. A different glint, small, focused, dynamic. It wavered between a faded dot, and a bright star; sometimes blurred, sometimes sharp. As the daylight ebbed away, it almost seemed to brighten, like the day’s light being concentrated into one, fine point. Fluttering between the branches, a lone adventurer exploring the night. Its presence seemed to bring everything to life, the leaves rising with a lively glow, the drops entranced by its light. Yet it made no sound, just a silent spectator, seeing without touching.  
&emsp; From below, a silhouette peered curiously at the glint. His body was dark, indistinguishable; only two glittering sparks in his eyes. Those eyes, filled with emotion, unreadable in the darkness. A twinkle – perhaps a blink, or just the glint passing behind a branch. He made no sound, nor any movement. As he gazed, the glow grew larger. He tilted his head. A faint shadow of light passed over his face, tracing the smooth contours of his nose and cheek, catching the echo of a smile. The glint approached, and he raised a hand. A soft gasp escaped his breath, soundlessly disappearing into the night.  
&emsp; He closed his eyes.
