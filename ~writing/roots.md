When Java master Olst was young, he was especially fond of paths and roads.

One day, Java master Zuki sent young Olst on a journey crossing a large grass plain.

‘But master, without roads, how will I know I am taking the right path?’ enquired Olst.

‘If it matters to you so much, follow where the grass has been trodden.’

Upon inspection, Olst noticed there were very many winding tracks of worn-down grass. Some were narrower than others, some were newer than others, some cut cleanly through the grass, some melted together with the grass around.

‘But master, with so many paths and half-paths, how will I know which is the correct one?’

Master Zuki stroked his chin and tapped the young Olst on his head.

‘In truth, there are no paths, only routes taken by others. Who says where grass ends and path begins?’

And so young Olst was enlightened.
