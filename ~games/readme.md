I don’t think I can really class as a hardcore gamer – I end up making games more than I play them, as you do – but I do enjoy my games.

## Rhythm Games

I got *really* into rhythm games during a summer camp in 2023. It started with an attempt in an arcade, followed by me trying [*Phigros*](~) on my friend’s iPad, and finally [*osu!*](~) on someone’s gaming laptop. I fell into it way quicker than I could’ve ever imagined.

In summer 2024, I started trying out other rhythm games too. I searched for them all over arcades while in China, in particular looking for CHUNITHM, a rhythm game which I’d heard (idek how) was really rare, but really fun. I also downloaded Arcaea and Deemo. I realise all these rhythm games are quite different in style (I think that was my unconscious reasoning when picking which to try), which makes it quite refreshing to flit between them!

### Phigros
The ultimate rhythm game.

I don’t get how you can get better than this. It’s literally perfect. You can create anything in it, heck, you can even emulate other rhythm games in it. The graphics are simple, sure, but they’re elegant, and the devs do some super creative stuff with what they’ve got.

> See [Phigros](../Phigros) for more.

### CHUNITHM
I was actually so excited when I first found it, ideky. I think I’d just hyped it up myself, and after coming up empty at so many arcades, all the excitement had built up when I finally did find one.

Yeah, it’s fun. Arcade is such a different exerience to casual Phigros on a table, I gotta say. And imho CHUNITHM is the best arcade rhythm game, which is why I wanted to play it so much. It’s so active! Like, you’re standing up when playing, you’re immersed inside the box of the machine, and you’ve got a massive screen in front of you. You can really get pumped.

### Arcaea
Oh yeah, this is as fun as it looks. Arc notes really are something. And just as I thought when watching other people play, the 3D element makes it really quite difficult.

### *osu!*
I haven’t played it in a while. I’m really not that great, and I just can’t seem to ‘get’ the rhythm in the same as I do with touch on a screen. But it’s fun.

## Bloons

### Bloons TD 6
Pretty much the perfect game for me.

### Bloons Pop!
An adorable and wonderfully chill game with animations and graphics arguably even smoother and cuter than btd6. I really enjoy popping this up when bored on the go, though of course now all my time is dedicated to learning and coding instead :v
