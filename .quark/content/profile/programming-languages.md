All the...


## Scratch

I’ve been Scratching ever since, like, year 3 in primary school. I’ve created numerous high-quality games throughout the years, which you can find on my (now very inactive) [profile](~).


## Python

I first touched this at the end of primary school, but didn’t properly pick it up until I got involved with *The Monkeyopolis Times* and helped work on our server bot. That then led me to work on my own bot [Penguin](https://github.com/Sup2point0/PENGUIN), which totally skyrocketed my understanding of Python (pro tip: if you wanna learn Python, a Discord bot is a wicked project to start). I’m now really comfortable and confident in Python – I think I can call myself ‘fluent’, whatever that might mean.


## C#

I somewhat recently started properly delving into this, after non-committally ‘trying’ to learn it for a while. And honestly, I really should’ve done this sooner, cuz I picked it up *really* quickly – like, way more quickly than I imagined. Turns out already knowing one programming language and having a solid understanding of coding fundamentals makes other languages unimaginably easier to learn; half the deal is just translating syntax, after all.


## HTML / CSS

Been tinkering with web dev on-off for many years. I indirectly learnt a lot of HTML through using it in Github-Flavoured Markdown (which supports HTML rendering), and basic CSS through using the StyleBot Chrome extension to inject CSS into websites. I didn’t properly start ‘doing’ it, thiugh, until I started working on [*Quarkdown*](~) – which was a lot more involved with layouts and animations and all, especially in the navbar.


## JavaScript

Naturally, that leads us on JavaScript, and I tragically cannot say I have made my own JS framework.[^framework] However, it really wasn’t that difficult to pick up (as expected after realising the ease with which I learnt C#), although I did very quickly get hit with my first bug involving `undefined` variables that would otherwise have been immediately avoided with TypeScript. Speaking of which, I’m still working on installing `npm` so it’ll just be renaming to file extension to `.ts` for debugging in VSCode for now 0.o

[^framework]: Wait, does Quarkdown count??


## Swift

A really beautiful language that sorta took the best of Python and C# and fused them to create an almost flawless ~ ...he says, having not ever run a single line of Swift code.


## SQL (SQLite)

Used a little in [ignis](https://github.com/Sup2point0/ignis). Nothing groundbreaking, I suppose. Surprisingly fast though.


## Markdown

Not a programming language by any means, but I feel it absolutely deserves a mention here because ***damn** I love Markdown*. I love it so, so much and if you’ve ever looked in [*Assort*](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort) you’ll know just how much I use for anything and everything. It’s so quick and easy, renders so pristinely on GitHub, and is so portable that transferring it could not be easier. Like damn, I do my homework with it.


## LaTeX

Like how I initially ‘learnt’ HTML, most of my LaTeX understanding comes from minor usage in GitHub-Flavoured Markdown, which supports embedded LaTeX. It’s pretty nice, what can I say. Mathematical rendering just has that unrivalled elegance.


## JSON / JSON Schema

Again, not a programming language, but a ubiquitous tool used throughout all of them. And JSON Schema integration in VSCode has been incredible for convenience and productivity – being able to have tooltips and autocomplete for JSON files makes debugging and verification so much easier. Being able to validate JSON files in code is also really helpful for robustness.


## XML / YAML / TOML

I mean, there’s not much to say here, but yeah, I’ve worked with these to a limited extent. XML for C# docstrings, YAML for GitHub Actions, TOML for `pyproject` files.
