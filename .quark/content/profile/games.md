I don’t think I can really class as a hardcore gamer – I end up making games more than I play them, as you do – but I do enjoy my games.

## Rhythm Games

I got *really* into rhythm games during a summer camp in 2023. It started with an attempt in an arcade, followed by me trying [*Phigros*](~) on my friend’s iPad, and finally [*osu!*](~) on someone’s gaming laptop. I fell into it way quicker than I could’ve ever imagined.

### Phigros
The ultimate rhythm game.

I don’t get how you can get better than this. It’s literally perfect. You can create anything in it, heck, you can even emulate other rhythm games in it.

Playing it one-handed quickly gets difficult, but also such a vibe.

### *osu!*
I’m not that great or dedicated, but I’ve played it. 3 or 4 might be my upper limit.

### Bloons TD 6
Pretty much the perfect game for me.

### Bloons Pop!
An adorable and wonderfully chill game with animations and graphics arguably even smoother and cuter than btd6. I really enjoy popping this up when bored on the go, though of course now all my time is dedicated to learning and coding instead :v
