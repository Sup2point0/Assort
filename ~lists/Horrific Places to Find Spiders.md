<!-- #QUARK leave. -->

1. In a clothes drawer - Now you little bugger, where have you gone.
2. Not in the clothes drawer - No. No, no, no, where has it gone. Why isn’t it in here.
3. In your hair - CALL IN THE UCAV, WHERE THE NUKES AT
4. Amidst the shower curtains - If one suddenly spawns in while I’m naked, wet and vulnerable in the shower, you best believe it’s gonna be inhumane warfare in there. That spider ain’t making it out alive, and I ain’t making it out without lasting trauma.
5. On the covers - How am I gonna kill this without it bleeding all over my precious bed?
6. In the covers - Would you *please* stop crawling around.
7. Under the covers - PANIC. CODE RED. ABORT. ABORT.
8. In a slipper - Particularly close-tipped ones where you can’t see what’s inside. Can you imagine slipping your bare foot in there after a shower, only to feel... \*shudder*
9. In a book - Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have left this textbook unread for 7 years...
10. In a swimming pool - In all honesty, there’s probably worse stuff in there anyway.
11. In a laptop - HELLO???
12. In your pocket – Skin-crawling, eye-twitching, heart-stopping.
13. In your food - And how did it even get there?
14. In a spider web - Hello, FBI?
15. In your mouth - I think at this point it’s over.
