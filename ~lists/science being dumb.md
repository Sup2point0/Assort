# When Science is Stupid

There are some things that I find *incredibly*, *abjectly* dumb in science, that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.


### This convention of separating quantity and units with a slash
I never understand why this is the preferred notation, when slash so definitively represents division. In no way are you *dividing* the quantity by the unit, so why slash? A pipe sign, backslash or even colon would be so much better. Or, just be normal, and use brackets!

### Magnitude scale of stellar brightness
Who the actual flip decided a reverse scale was a good idea. Cuz it is absolutely not. I mean, I just don’t see why it’s necessary, at all. There’s absolutely no reason for smaller values to be brighter, and all it does is make the scale more confusing and unintuitive. Just use a logarithmic scale for lumens, rather than creating a whole new unitless and pointless scale.

### The abomination that is Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams
