<!-- #QUARK synopsis. -->

<!-- #QUARK leave? -->
Incredible creations and resources I’ve discovered in the internet through various avenues, just like you discovering this within *Assort*.
<!-- #QUARK leave. -->

I’ve listed them in reverse chronological order, so that the further you go, the more timeless they get!

> [!Note]
> Depending on how far into the futute you’re reading this, there’s a pretty nonzero some of these sites no longer exist or have changed URL. Unfortunately I can’t, like, archive the entirety of all of these (as much as I’d like to).

<!-- #QUARK note? -->
<!-- #QUARK only?
There is fsr an especially poignant feeling I’m filled with when archiving these steadily ageing websites. Maybe it’s cuz I’m Gen Z, and I witnessed the internet reverse-mature from its emo teenage years to the... well, whatever the internet of today is.

I don’t know, there’s just something so nostalgic and innocent about the content-filled, cool-in-its-own-way design of the websites of the 2000s. That feeling’s especially invoked in me by *The Codeless Code* and old reddit.

That stuff’s becoming ancient history now...

The journey began sometime around here, and I’ve been haphazardly making my way through them one by one. I’m just taking it slow and enjoying the ride, y’know? As of April Fools’ 2024, I’m on XKCD ~.

### [Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide)
<!-- #QUARK caption? -->
> Sometime Prior to Summer 2023
<!-- #QUARK caption. -->

I never intended to learn Ruby, and I have literally no clue why I found this. But it was written in a delightfully charming, witty and yeah, poignant (tho I didn’t understand the word at all at the time) manner, so it hooked me in alright. For a couple chapters, at least, until I decided I really needed to spend my time on other stuff.

And no, I haven’t learnt Ruby, but it looked like a cool and unique language. Maybe I’ll consider it again sometime in the future.

A journal of a trip to Antarctica. Isn’t that insane. I always wnated to read it. Just never found the time, and interest died away. Maybe I’ll read it sometime.
