PowerPoint is *so* awesome. But like anything, there’s still plenty of room for improvement, and there are loads of features I’d love to see!


## Features I’d Love in PowerPoint

- side scroll
> It still confuzzles me how this isn’t a feature yet, when it’s so standard across all other applications, and is one of the most useful tools for navigation. `shift` + `scroll` is such a convenient and efficient way of moving around when zoomed in – I have plenty of experience from coding in Scratch – and it’s super disruptive to have to carefully move your house to drag the horizontal scroll bar.
