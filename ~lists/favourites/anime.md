# Anime & Manga

Eh, this is supposed to be a tier list of favourites, but I guess I can just go through all the stuff I’ve read and watched, since there’s too little and of different genres too.

### Ultraman
I have watched (and been into) Ultraman (on and off, as with many things) all my life. It’s live action, so it’s not really anime or manga; but it shares plenty of similarities, so I suppose it counts as constant exposure to Japanese content.

### Yu-Gi-Oh!
I go through the details of my *Yu-Gi-Oh* journey over in [its folder](../../Yu-Gi-Oh!), but I suppose this would be the first ‘anime’ I watched as a kid. I never thought of it really as an anime tho, so I didn’t think I was into anime at all. I mean, I was who pronounced it ‘a-nime’ (`/ˈanʌɪm/`, as in ‘time’) at first :v

Then when I got back into it, I realised not only did I love the anime spirit of *Yu-Gi-Oh*, I also quite like Japanese content in general – I loved the music, the language, and all.

### Suzume
Then, I watched [*Suzume no Tojimari*]() at the cinema on a whim, and was totally blown away. Only then, I realised, *ayo, this is for me*. It’s not an anime series, only a film, but it was enough. I actually love this stuff. So I haven’t seen much anime, but I can definitely say I’m an anime lover.

### Oshi no Ko
Aw yeah. How I came across this was... a number of ajar doors that I peeked into but ignored, until I reached the end of the corridor and decided to turn around.

With a few of my friends who got me into rhythm games, someone must’ve been playing the [opening theme]() on *osu!*, I think. Then my guy who got me into Phigros showed me the [music video]() on YouTube while we watching random stuff, though I didn’t think too much of it. Only when I saw [EK]()’s [video]() about the custom level he created for this song did I realise *oh my days, it’s this song*. And only after confirming with someone that it was a kinda famous song did I realise *ayo, this song frickin slaps* (seriously, idk how it took me so long).

So I was high on the OP for a few days, and it took me yet *more* time to become curious as to its origins. With that, I finally found the [*Oshi no Ko*]() manga – binged that within 3 days or so – and then shortly thereafter found the anime. Now I know. I am in deep with this stuff.

~~I’m actually falling into the abyss for Aqua dude~~

### Music
This was really difficult to mention anywhere else, but throughout this whole journey, music has been the major catalyst and what’s really kept me into it. I don’t know why, but for some reason Japanese songs are just SUCH A VIBE.

I always knew the *Ultraman* soundtracks were epic, but it took me realising how awesome the *Yu-Gi-Oh* soundtracks were to finally appreciate the music. *Suzume* took this further with the 2 insane main themes by [RADWIMPS](). Somewhere along the way I also came across [Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs](), an absolutely based track (pun intended), as well as the ultimate rhythm game song.

[Phigros]() also happens to contain several Japanese songs, so that only fueled the fire – even guilty pleasures like [Eternal Snow]() by [Abyss Idols]().
