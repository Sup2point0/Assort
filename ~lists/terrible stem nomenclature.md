# Dumb Nomenclature in STEM Subjects

Scientists and mathematicians are infamous for being absolutely terrible at naming stuff, which isn’t always the case – there are [plenty of words](coolest%20scientific%20nomenclature.md) in STEM that are totally epic (mostly in chemistry). That being said, there are quite a few terms (mostly in physics) that are really... well, stupid.


### The abomination that is ‘liquefaction’
*Whose* idea was it to name it *liquefaction* instead of *liquification*, which makes so much more sense and sounds so much cooler?

### rarefaction
Ew.
