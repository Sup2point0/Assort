Being a software developer is tough. So, if you’re ever in a pickle, and hopefully not one to do with pickling, here are some suggestions to help you fix the issue.

1. ***Fix by feature.*** It’s a feature, not a bug.
2. ***Fix by coffee break.*** But sir, the code’s compiling...
3. ***Fix by force.*** Have you tried turning it off and on again?
4. ***Fix by deployment.*** Well, it worked on *my* machine...
5. ***Fix by forgetfulness.*** Wait, what bug were we talking about?
6. ***Fix by futility.*** Repairing this code would take far too long
7. ***Fix by accuracy.*** If it won’t pass the tests, the tests won’t parse it. Can’t fail the tests if there are no tests.
8. ***Fix by deprecation.*** Just get an RTX 5090, bruh.
9. ***Fix by time travel.*** We’ll delegate this problem to future me, sounds good.
10. ***Fix by blame.*** This is clearly a bug in the library, not my problem.
11. ***Fix by extrapolation.*** If it works for this input, it must work for any input.
12. ***Fix by paywall.*** If they have to pay to access this, then no one will realise it’s broken.
13. ***Fix by fantasy.*** Wouldn’t it be nice if this bug were fixed?
14. ***Fix by firewall.*** I wonder why all those complaint tickets stopped?
15. ***Fix by calculation.*** By my calculations, this bug is unfixable.
16. ***Fix by JavaScript.*** These frameworks suck, what if we just created our own?
17. ***Fix by commit.*** If the commit message says it’s fixed, it must be fixed.
18. ***Fix by adverts.*** Cover the broken content with endorsed NSFW advertisements.
19. ***Fix by homogeneity.*** If none of the code works, then none of it’s broken.
20. ***Fix by NullPointerException.*** `sudo rm -rf`
21. ***Fix by merge conflict.*** There must be *some* combination of code in there that works.
22. ***Fix by threading.*** What if we used multithreading to speed up the code?
23. ***Fix by virus.*** If we infect the software with a virus, then they won’t be able to tell it’s broken.
24. ***Fix by inheritance.*** This problem was inherited from another class, so it’s outside our scope.
25. ***Fix by facade.*** If we just show them a video of it doing the right thing, we can avoid actually coding anything.
26. ***Fix by fable.*** There was once a monk...
27. ***Fix by duct tape.*** There’s nothing duct tape and a screwdriver can’t solve.
28. ***Fix by frontend.*** If the user can’t navigate this annoying UI, they won’t find any bugs.
29. ***Fix by artificial intelligence.*** Have you tried adding AI to it?
30. ***Fix by definition.*** `#PRAGMA fixed=true`
