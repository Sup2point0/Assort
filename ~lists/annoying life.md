## Annoying Things in Life

- pencil lead keeps breaking
> I swear, *how* does this keep on happening!? How weak is the lead? I’ve used a short length and am purposefully pressing lightly, yet it *still* manages to find a way to snap.

- rubber creases paper
> It is inevitable. And it is just the worst.

- runny nose for several days when even slightly chilled.
