# *Victory!*

***Victory!*** is a custom card game I made for my sister and I to play, heavily inspired by [*Yu-Gi-Oh!*](../Yu-Gi-Oh!/)

## Evolution

In primary school my friends and I would draw and duel with our own *Yu-Gi-Oh* cards. In secondary school, especially during [Covid-19](/), I started doing the same for me and my sister.

So, it started with me drawing the cards on paper. I’d fold pieces of A4 paper in half 4 times (bringing us down to A8) and cut along the folds (with a guillotine, not scissors, thankfully), giving 16 pieces per sheet. Each card’s frame, text, and art would be hand-drawn with pen[^pen] and ruler, and for special cards I’d even mix up the colours. It was a lotta effort for sure, but every card was hand-crafted and made with love. You can find some samples [here](../.assets/Victory!/hand-drawn/) =)

[^pen]: With [Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V5](~) pens – absolute bliss.

But handwriting a card effect on half an A8-size card is... not easy, to say the least. As tiny as my handwriting is, it still can’t match what a computer can print. So, I started designing the cards in PowerPoint to print off and cut.

Now, I’m working on a digital card simulator in Unity, which’ll have a duel simulator, a card browser/creator, a deck builder, and a pack opener![^packs]

[^packs]: My sister loves, uh, opening packs a little too much.
