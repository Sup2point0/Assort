# Problems/Bugs/Issues with Scratch

1. If you broadcast the same message in a single tick/frame, it will only count as being broadcast once
2. Messages perfectly attached to blocks get moved when you reload the project
3. Clean up blocks just moves them into a straight column
4. Editing variables doesn't let you select them for all sprites/this sprite only
5. 'Set variable to ()' blocks automatically select a cloud variable, which means accidentally clicking them will reset a cloud variable
6. No way to have two inputs, i.e. <level = (2 or 4)>
7. Converting between Vector and Bitmap is unreliable
8. When drawing in Vector, random spikes and crevices can appear
9. Bitmap lines don't let you use shift to get them perfectly straight
10. Shapes drawn in Bitmap can't be selected in Vector; they instantly connect into one sprite
11. You can't make custom boolean blocks
12. Wait () seconds is inaccurate
13. No way to fill the whole Bitmap sprite in one colour - every pixel has to be individually filled
14. Not enough titling fonts
15. Pen transparency effect doesn't work
16. Costumes that are just a line need an extra dot or something to give them dimensions, otherwise they won't show up
17. Clicking a sprite even when in full screen will select that sprite, causing lag
