# Dryconix
<!-- #SQUARK live! feat!
| dest = yugioh/decks/dryconix
| desc = My 60-card Dogmatika Drytron Ritual tech deck.
| style = yugioh
| duality = dark
| shard = yugioh
-->

This is my absolute favourite deck of all time. Despite having 9 Ritual Monsters, single copies of staples, and ~~nearing~~ 60 cards, itâ€™s still surprisingly consistent, insanely versatile, and can definitely hold its own.

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Drytron Alpha Thuban](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Alpha_Thuban) | x3 | |
| [Drytron Zeta Aldibah](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Zeta_Aldibah) | x2 | Dropped to x2 cuz itâ€™s *ridiculously* tight on space. I really wish it could recover Ritual Spells from the Grave, since it becomes rather useless late game. |
| [Drytron Delta Altais](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Delta_Altais) | x2 | My favourite Drytron, the draw is always insane. |
| [Drytron Gamma Eltanin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Gamma_Eltanin) | x2 | Pivotal for comebacks, but I donâ€™t need the extension normally. |
| [Drytron Beta Rastaban](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Beta_Rastaban) | x1 | Saviour against Runick or Dimension Shifter, seriously clutch. |
| [Ultimate Knight Alpha Ursatron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Knight_Alpha_Ursatron) | x2 | Not *perfect* support by any means (since itâ€™s unsearchable and canâ€™t be used as Material for Mu Beta Fafnir or Herald of Mirage Lights) but being able to search Fafnir for negate protection is wonderful. |
| [Drytron Meteonis Draconids](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Meteonis_Draconids) | x1 | Very strong against certain archetypes, and epic for OTKs. |
| [Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Meteonis_Quadrantids) | x1 | Ruins backrow. |
| [Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | My favourite Ritual Monster after White Zoa. Being able to actually play it is so wonderful. |
| [Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Great to leave on an endboard, and clearing threatening backrow before my opponent realises whatâ€™s going on. |
| [Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Often underestimated, but super versatile against decks that just canâ€™t handle both targeting and destruction immunity *and* high ATK â€“ Labrynth, Runick, even Tearlaments and Kashtira. |
| [Shinobaron Peacock](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Insane removal, especially against Avramax, Mirrorjade or HEROs. |
| [White Relic of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Relic_of_Dogmatika) | x1 | Surprisingly good for OTKs, and an easy out to an Accesscode Talker if didnâ€™t manage to strike for game. |
| [White Knight of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Knight_of_Dogmatika) | x1 | Great when weâ€™ve got nothing else. |
| [White Zoa of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dogmatika_Alba_Zoa) | x1 | Technically Alba Zoa now, but whatever, White Zoa is the better name. Anyway, the ace of the deck! |
| [Diviner of the Herald](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Diviner_of_the_Herald) | x3 | Does scare people into thinking this is Herald Drytron, but nooo, weâ€™re going into Lv7 Synchro toolbox B) |

  <summary> <b> Extra Deck </b> </summary> <br>

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Drytron Mu Beta Fafnir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Mu_Beta_Fafnir) | x2 | Insane consistency tool. As long as we can get 2 Drytrons on the field, thisâ€™ll guarantee any missing pieces we need. If we donâ€™t end with Amorphactor Pain, it even provides a negate to protect against boardbreakers. Unfortunately, for Extra Deck space Iâ€™ve had to cut this down to 2 copies, but rarely does that come back to bite. |
| [Linkuriboh](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Linkuriboh) | x1 | Pivotal for optilical combo sequencing. Clutch when you need it. |
| [Relinquished Anima](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Relinquished_Anima) | x1 | Hilarious when it works, perfect for plucking back a Lava Golem too. |
| [Herald of Mirage Lights](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Herald_of_Mirage_Lights) | x1 | This, *this*, is the missing piece I spent so long looking for â€“ too often do I end with extra bodies (especially if Iâ€™ve used Gamma) which donâ€™t do anything, and I canâ€™t clean up for anything else (IP Masquerena would take even more Extra Deck space for other staples, which I refuse to resort to) â€“ but what would really help is a recovery option. Thatâ€™s exactly what Herald of Mirage Lights does, grabbing back not 1, but *2* Ritual cards â€“ how awesome is that! No longer do I need to rest on the Heart of the Cards every time my opponent dismantles my board and I have no more Rituals left in hand. |
| [Clear Wing Synchro Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Clear_Wing_Synchro_Dragon) | x1 | This is my favourite Synchro Monster, so naturally I was delighted when I realised I could throw it in Drytron. A stellar option if we donâ€™t have enough to bring out a double-Tribute Ritual Monster. |
| [Wind Pegasus @Ignister](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wind_Pegasus_@Ignister) | x1 | Works under Amorphactor Pain and in the Grave, even has Spell/Trap removal for followup. |
| [Herald of the Arc Light](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Herald_of_the_Arc_Light) | x3 | Of course, the perfect Monster to bury from our Extra Deck. And with Drytron, the more Rituals in hand, the better. We can even Synchro Summon it with Ash Blossom (Lv3 Tuner) and a Drytron (Lv1), which is better than keeping Ash in hand, since this can negate any card or effect â€“ with a search right after too! Aside from working under Amorphactor Pain (since it Tributes itself as cost, so its effect wonâ€™t be negated), it even blocks Droplet by preventing anyone from sending cards to the Grave as cost. Just insane value. |
| [Elder Entity N'tss](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Elder_Entity_N'%27'tss) | x1 | Oneâ€™s enough, just for the situations where we really need it. |
| [Garura, Wings of Resonant Life](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Garura,_Wings_of_Resonant_Life) | x1 | For Super Polymerization and any effect that buries from the Extra Deck. |
| [Lyrilusc â€“ Assembled Nightingale](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lyrilusc_-_Assembled_Nightingale) | x1 | If the opponent has an unbreakable board but no interruptions, then itâ€™s time for an emergency OTK with Assembled Nightingale and White Relic! |
| [Raidraptor â€“ Ultimate Falcon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Raidraptor_-_Ultimate_Falcon) | x1 | I actually love this card, considering my first deck was Raidraptor. *So* many decks just cannot handle this being dropped on them. |
| [Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Infinitrack_Fortress_Megaclops) | x1 | Waking the Dragon moment, what can I say... |

### Spells

  <summary> <b> display </b> </summary> <br>

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Meteonis Drytron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Meteonis_Drytron) | x2 | Always nice to have 2, just in case one gets banished, or to allow more than 1 Ritual Summon in later turns. |
| [Drytron Fafnir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Fafnir) | x3 | Eh, the search is cool and all, but Iâ€™m here for *negate protection* â€“ that feeling when your opponent Solemns Meteonis Drytron and is left confuzzled as to why it didnâ€™t work â€“ also, the level manipulyzacion effect that no one pays any attention too can *really* disrupt any Synchro or Xyz decks. |
| [Cyber Emergency](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Emergency) | x3 | Quality searcher, can grab a Draconids or Quadrantids to Tribute for White Zoa too if needed. |
| [Drytron Nova](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Nova) | x3 | This deck needs all the consistency it can get. |
| [Dogmatikabre](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dogmatikamacabre) | x1 | Just for White Zoa, but also useful with the lower Level Dogmatika Rituals if I have Herald of the Arc Lights in the Grave. |
| [Nadir Servant](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Nadir_Servant) | x2 | Insane value, searching an extra Ritual Monster to Tribute and any Ritual card (by sending Arc Light). Had several games where topdecking this instantly turned the fight around. |
| [Dogmatikatrix](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dogmatikamatrix) | x2 | Just incredible searching power, especially if going second, and leaves Drytrons free to search for other Ritual cards. Once weâ€™ve got White Zoa out, we can even scout out our opponentâ€™s Extra Deck or bury any Monster from our own for even more value. |
| [Where Arf Thou?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Where_Arf_Thou%3F) | x2 | Another searcher for consistency, can search Droll & Lock Bird if Iâ€™ve got all the Drytron modules I need. |
| [Preparation of Rites](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Preparation%20of%20Rites) | x1 | Searches Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon for opening setup, or White Relic of Dogmatika for OTK, and a free recovery (especially for Dogmatikabre to revive Zoa). |
| [Pre-Preparation of Rites](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pre-Preparation%20of%20Rites) | x1 | Searches Dogmatikabre and a free Dogmatika Ritual Monster to Tribute, and acts as an Ash bait, even if it is a dead draw later on. |

### Traps

| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Drytron Meteor Shower](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Meteor_Shower) | x1 | Itâ€™s hilarious how few people actually know Drytron even has a Counter Trap, but itâ€™s not bad at all, despite having no Grave effects like those of so many other archetypes. Hitting a Summon can often be just as devastating as negating an effect, undoing all the work put into bringing out a duel closer. |

</details>

### Staples

<details open>
  <summary> <b> display </b> </summary> <br>

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ash_Blossom_&_Joyous_Spring/) | x1 | I didnâ€™t use to run this, since stopping people from playing the game isnâ€™t fun, but... man am I tired of Maxx C... and Branded Fusion into Mirrorjade... and Chixiao into Chengying â€“ you get the idea. Also, most of the time I Normal Summon it, and tune it with a Drytron to make a spare Herald of the Arc Light! Insane value. |
| [Droll & Lock Bird](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Droll_&_Lock_Bird) | x1 | Canâ€™t use it against Maxx C since it literally locks myself, but searchable with *Where Arf Thou?* and shuts some decks down nicely. Quite a mean handtrap tho. |
| [Lava Golem](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lava_Golem) | x1 | Such a powerful boardbreaker. Fits perfectly with Drytron since it canâ€™t be Normal Summoned, and Drytron doesnâ€™t really need a Normal Summon anyway. |
| [Nibiru, the Primal Being](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Nibiru,_the_Primal_Being) | x1 | A really *horrible* handtrap, but I run it just for Crossout. |
| [Called by the Grave](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Called_by_the_Grave) | x1 | Unfortunately, handtraps exist. |
| [Crossout Designator](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Crossout_Designator) | x1 | Well, I thought, if Iâ€™m already running literally every staple card at 1 copy, I might as well play Crossout to counter any of them, yâ€™know? |
| [Forbidden Droplet](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Droplet) | x1 | Another reason to leave spare Drytron modules on board. Splendid in Drytron, especially when going second, since the modules donâ€™t really care if theyâ€™re in the Hand or Grave. |
| [Super Polymerization](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization) | x1 | A wonderful boardbreaker, if a bit toxic. |
| [Ultimate Slayer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Slayer) | x1 | People should give this more recognition honestly. Perfect against Synchro decks to send a Herald of the Arc Light for an extra search, or against Fusion decks to send a N'tss for a free pop. Nicely avoids Mirrorjade and Chengyingâ€™s effects. |
| [Triple Tactics Talent](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Triple_Tactics_Talent) | x1 | Quality response and all too easy to trigger. |
| [Infinite Impermanence](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Infinite_Impermanence) | x1 | Why only 1, I know. I donâ€™t really play it as interruption (unless itâ€™s Aluber or Chixiao), but rather an opener when going second to neutralise a threat or draw out a negate. |
| [Evenly Matched](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Evenly_Matched) | x1 | Actually cracked. |
| [Waking the Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Waking_the_Dragon) | x1 | Not a staple, I know. Yet the amount of times this has worked and saved me by bringing out Ultimate Falcon or Infinitrack Megaclops is *staggering*. |

| [Drytron Eclipse](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Eclipse) | x1 | Surprisingly clutch, super useful for recovering a Drytron mech to sacrifice for White Zoa, and the ATK boost is splendid with Draconids for OTKs. |
| [Pot of Extravagance](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pot_of_Extravagance) | x1 | Drytron wasnâ€™t too dependent on the Extra Deck, so this was great (even if it did lock Delta Altais), but now... yeah no, no way weâ€™re losing cards out of the Extra Deck. |

## Strategy

### End Board
The dream endboard consists of White Zoa, Amorphactor Pain, Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon, Elder Entity.

White Zoa needs 3 cards to Ritual Summon â€“ itself, Dogmatikabre, and a Draconids or Quadrantids in Hand to Tribute (or we could have a Lv8 Ritual and banish an Arc Light from the Grave, that works too). Regardless, itâ€™s quite a lot to ask, and while it has stellar protection and a devastating effect, itâ€™s probably not enough to hold up on its own â€“ which means we canâ€™t just abandon the Drytron side of things. So, Iâ€™ll only bring it out if I can still Ritual Summon other Ritual Monsters with Meteonis Drytron.

Luckily, Drytronâ€™s got... wouldnâ€™t say plenty, but definitely enough cards to search out all the Ritual Spells and Monsters we need. Nadir Servant is great for searching any missing piece we need, and if we go second Dogmatikatrix can grab both White Zoa and Dogmatikabre all in one go, or even another copy of itself if weâ€™ve already got one of those.

### Strengths
Drytron is definitely strong. Itâ€™s fallen behind the meta, sure, but it can still *do* things, and is plenty powerful if left unchecked. The archetype is by no means â€˜grindyâ€™, but grinds decently well â€“ cycling the modules each turn for virtually no cost, and gaining card advantage through Drytron Alpha and Delta.

Due to the way itâ€™s structured, Drytron has a few niche advantages. The effects of our modules donâ€™t activate on the field, and their search is part of resolution, which means we can play under Skill Drain and other effects that relate to the field. Of course, the Rituals weâ€™re aiming to end on wonâ€™t work, but luckily their high ATK means generally we can win through plain beatdown. We also donâ€™t rely on Summoning from the Extra Deck too much, so while a lock or floodgate does hurt a bit, it doesnâ€™t hurt anywhere as much as with other decks. Funniest of all of course, is how we benefit from burying from the Extra Deck â€“ almost half of our Extra Deck is very useful when sent to the Grave.

### Weaknesses
As strong as it can be, Drytron is chock-full of weaknesses. Of course, the most pressing is consistency â€“ unlike most other archetypes with 1-card starters, we need at least 2 Drytron modules to actually combo. And being a Ritual deck, we need to accumulate so many different cards to be able to even bring out any kind of boss Monster, so any negated search could be combo-ending. Donâ€™t forget that all the effort is so resource-intensive that weâ€™re often left with an empty hand after dropping everything we can, so a comeback in turn 3 too often relies on Heart of the Cards. Drytron can indeed have a pretty high ceiling, but do remember that weâ€™re hard capped by 2 or 3 Ritual Summons each turn (and really only 1 in late game), and this requires having an opening hand with pretty much every card being live.

What hurts most, though, is that itâ€™s vulnerable to almost every form of interruption. Handtrap-wise when going fist, youâ€™ve got Ash Blossom and Ghost Belle negating the modules, Infinite Impermanence, Effect Veiler and even Ghost Ogre choking Mu Beta Fafnir, and of course Maxx C and Droll & Lock Bird which are utter pain. Donâ€™t even mention Bystials. Any grave disruption or floodgate, of which there is plenty â€“ Called By The Grave, Ishizu shufflers, Abyss Dweller â€“ totally kills the deck.

### Adamancipator

### Blue-Eyes
Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon is such a pain. Luckily, Draconids canâ€™t be targeted by it, and has excellent removal in case the opponent has a higher ATK Monster. Ironically, the best weapon against them is their own ace Monster â€“ Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon.

### Branded Despia
This is actually so fun to play against, even if I do end up losing most of the time. Since its speciality is removal and doesnâ€™t have negates at all, it presents a far more interesting challenge to overcome â€“ many of my most exhilarating and memorable duels have been against Branded Despia. I love playing against duelists who really *know* the deck and donâ€™t just play it cuz meta. Especially those who take it further and stretch its capabilitys, like Fusion Summoning twice in one Chain Link with Lubellion and Branded in Red.

Amorphactor Pain is my greatest weapon against them, but even then they can easily battle over it, and if I want to dismantle their board, Mirrorjade presents a difficult challenge to remove.

### Bystial
Well, Iâ€™ma head out.

Yeah no, Bystial totally kills Drytron.

### Dark Magician
Its only real interruption is the banish from Dark Magical Circle, which could be critical if weâ€™ve got a weak hand, but is usually easy to overcome. Quadrantids is lethal against Dark Magician, since they canâ€™t recover their Spell/Traps, and if theyâ€™ve activated Eternal Soul then they just end up nuking their own field.

### Dinomorphia
Dinomorphiaâ€™s pretty powerful at control, which Drytron tends to struggle against. Luckily while [Rexterm](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dinomorphia_Rexterm)â€™s ATK-modifying effect neutralises our Battle Phase, which will be our main way to deal with their Monsters, it doesnâ€™t stop our modules from activating their effects since they donâ€™t activate on the field. If we manage to get Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon on the field, theyâ€™re royally screwed. If we get an Amorphactor Pain with that too? Yeah, thatâ€™s gonna be rough. The only issue is stopping the opponent from just running over them.

### Dogmatika
Haha, Iâ€™m afraid you just milled my 3 ARC LIGHTS â€“ yeah, the mirror match is hilarious if they blindly mill my Extra Deck.

### Eldlich
Again, Chaos MAX Dragon. Can be a challenge to play against sometimes if they manage to snipe Meteonis Drytron in the Grave with Huaquero.

### Floowandereeze
What a pain to play against.

### Kashtira
Aside from it being a horribly generic, efficient, vicious deck, Kashtira actually canâ€™t handle targeting protection, and it canâ€™t go over 3000 ATK, making Chaos MAX Dragon a fantastic weapon against them... if I can actually bring it out in the first place, what with all my Zones locked.

### Labrynth
Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon insta-win. Labrynth canâ€™t handle targeting and destruction protection or that 4000 ATK, unless they bring out Skill Drain. Then weâ€™re screwed.

Alternatively, they trigger Waking the Dragon and we drop Ultimate Falcon on them, which is a definitive insta-win.

### Marincess
This shouldnâ€™t be that hard to beat, but it is. Yâ€™know what, returning to the original Ritual Monsters works wonderfully â€“ Draconids and Quadrantids keep pressure on them by clearing their Spell/Traps each turn, and Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon really hurts since they combo so much.

### Mathmech
I also play Mathmech myself, so Iâ€™m really familiar with how it works. And it can be really dangerous if weâ€™re uncareful. Luckily skipping their Main Phase 1 with Amorphactor Pain neutralises the threat of an OTK, and if they donâ€™t read and overlay into Alembertian or Laplacian while itâ€™s on the field then things will be much more difficult for them.

If they go first and drop Superfactorial early, then counterplay is really quite difficult with the resource rip and negate. Draconids is probably the most effective here, to remove materials before they can Synchro into Final Sigma or Link into Accesscode.

### Pendulum Magician
Never did I think I would hate such a cool deck (since I absolutely loved Yuyaâ€™s deck in Arc-V), but the endboards it creates are really, really toxic, and literally none of the cards are actually archetypical. Apollousa is enough to kill Drytron, but a Baronne de Fleur, Hope Harbinger, Borreload Savage Dragon, *and* Time Pendulumgraph too? Even if I draw Forbidden Droplet, itâ€™ll cripple my Hand, and I donâ€™t run Dark Ruler No More anymore.

### Runick
Honestly makes me want to crawl up and die. Whenever I face this, the race is on to grab Chaos MAX Dragon before they banish it, since just like with Labrynth, itâ€™s an insta-win. It feels *soo* good crashing into a Hugin to deal perfectly 8000 damage. Unless they have Skill Drain... and they probably do. In which case, Quadrantids is our only good option, since whenever they destroy it itâ€™ll bring back more Drytrons, hopefully to attack directly. Unless they have There Can Be Only One. Oh my days. What an absolute pain. And Dimensional Fissure. ALL the floodgates.

### Sky Striker
Itâ€™s beyond me how this deck even manages to put up a fight â€“ maybe they just always catch me on a subpar hand.

### Spright
Well, this is really tough to beat. Since everything in Drytron is an activated effect, negates really hurt, and Spright is full of them. Amorphactor Pain canâ€™t keep them at bay, and Chaos MAX Dragon falls to Spright Double Cross or a boosted Gigantic Spright.

If I want to win, I have to play as viciously as I can, which means not letting Spright play at all. Currently the best strategic Iâ€™ve found is to clear their field, which means they canâ€™t use their innate Special Summons. Hitting their Normal Summon with Meteor Shower or Draconids kills them entirely, unless they have Starter. If they start with Starter weâ€™re basically screwed, unless they Summon Gigantic with nothing else on the field, in which case hitting that with Draconids clears their field.

If itâ€™s Runick Spright, then thereâ€™s very little hope, what with the insane advantage Fountain generates and the free Lv2 Special Summons that we just canâ€™t stop.

### Swordsoul
Swordsoul and Swordsoul Tenyi, unlike Branded Despia, are such a pain to play against. Which is weird, since both decks feature single-card opening combos and tech in other Monsters of their Summoning tecnique â€“ and I even find Synchro Monsters cooler than Fusion Monsters. I suppose itâ€™s because Swordsoul is so braindead to play, and provides such easy access to high-Level Synchro Monsters that would otherwise be much more difficult to Summon.

### Tearlaments
Tearlaments is fine. No really, it dies to Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon or a turn one Amorphactor Pain. Ofc, [Kaleido-Heart](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Kaleido-Heart) and [Rulkallos](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Rulkallos) have some pretty wicked effects â€“ almost all effects of our Drytron cards involve Special Summoning, and we each module to be in circulation â€“ but if we manage to pull through, we can certainly take them down.

Whatâ€™s isnâ€™t fine tho, are the non-*Tearlaments* cards. Oh man, those are vicious. Ishizu, just like Bystial, totally kills Drytron, and does an even harsher job of it in the late-game, cleansing all of our modules right out of the Grave. And with Drytronâ€™s playstyle, weâ€™ll just be triggering [Kelbek](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Kelbek_the_Ancient_Vanguard)â€™s trigger effect right for them. And if theyâ€™ve come prepared, [Underworld Goddess](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Underworld_Goddess_of_the_Closed_World) is the easy out to Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon thatâ€™ll hurt us when trying to comeback too. Oh, and [Abyss Dweller](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Abyss_Dweller)? Just no.

### The Weather
The Weather is strangely terrifying to play against, since it has incredible grind game that Drytron happens to have difficulty countering. In particular, itâ€™s their Monsters banishing themselves as cost, and the protection and recovery for their Spell/Traps, that makes them so resilient. We donâ€™t have any real counter to their strategy, and anything I try to bring out just dies to the [Thundery Canvas](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Weather_Thundery_Canvas). Really, our best shot is to try and OTK with Lyrilusc â€“ Assembled Nightingale and White Relic of Dogmatika, but thatâ€™s not always the easiest to pull off.

## Rivals

### [Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mekk-Knight_Crusadia_Avramax)
I:P Masquerena makes no difference for Drytron, as none of our effects involve destruction anyway. Itâ€™s the battle invulnerability thatâ€™s the most problematic, since we do often rely on our naturally high ATK to take out the opponentâ€™s ace Monsters. So, Shinobaron Peacock is our only non-targeting non-destructive removal option â€“ which sounds bad, but at least itâ€™s searchable. Otherwise, weâ€™d have to rely on drawing Forbidden Droplet or, heaven forbid, triggering Nibiru.

### [Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Apollousa,_Bow_of_the_Goddess)
Drytronâ€™s worst nightmare. Seriously. If we donâ€™t draw a Spell/Trap out to this (or have everything necessary for a Ritual Summon in hand â€“ thatâ€™s rare), weâ€™re royally screwed. The issue, you see, is that Drytron cannot simply tank the negates or beat over it, because we rely exclusively on Special Summons, and canâ€™t Special Summon without activating Monster effects. The feeling of having all your modules negated... man, itâ€™s rough. The worst part? Often, Apolloussa is just one of our worries, cuz the opponent will have other interruptions or bodies for us to deal with.

## Questions

### Why no Cyber Angel Benten?
Yeah, Iâ€™d love to reliably have Diviner for Lv7 Synchro Monsters, but I just donâ€™t feel good playing Benten â€“ I donâ€™t really want to spend a Ritual search on it, using it feels like degeneracy, and above all I just donâ€™t like its art... at all.

### Why Dogmatikabre instead of Dogmatikalamity?
Sure, Dogmatikalamity lets you Tribute straight from the Extra Deck, but it has 3 major downsides â€“ it canâ€™t Ritual Summon from the Grave, it canâ€™t be searched by Pre-Preparation of Rites, and it locks you out of the Extra Deck.

Being able to revive from the Grave is huge, since it means we donâ€™t need to keep the Dogmatika Ritual Monsters in Hand, and can Tribute them for Drytrons. Even if White Zoa being ripped from our Hand or Deck, we can still bring it back; we can even search it ourselves with Foolish Burial, if needed. Itâ€™s just far more flexible and versatile in general, particularly in late game, where Dogmatikalamity would otherwise be dead draw.

Locking us out of the Extra Deck doesnâ€™t matter too much, since we could just drop White Zoa at the end of our combo anyway; but if we have Dogmatikatrix, bringing out a Dogmatika Ritual Monster as soon as possible means weâ€™d be able to see what our opponent is playing, and setup an endboard accordingly, or if weâ€™re lacking cards we need, send an Arc Light from our Extra Deck for a clutch search.

And of course, being searchable by Pre-Preparation of Rites is nice, freeing up our Zeta to search for Meteonis Drytron.
