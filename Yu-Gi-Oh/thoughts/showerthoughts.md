### If you were a monster card, who would you be?
This is actually a really tough one to answer. The first one that came to mind was [Fleurdelis](~), but then I finally came to my senses and realised [Dragonpulse Magician](~) exists. Love him. Favourite card as a kid. I used to just stare at the artwork of his card under the light. What can I say, Pendulums are hella mesmerising.
