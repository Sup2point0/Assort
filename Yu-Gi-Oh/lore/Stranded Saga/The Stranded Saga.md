> “I... can’t remember,” said Luce, taking a step towards them.

<h2 align="center" name="Preface"> PREFACE </h2>

Many have spoken of the *dreamscape*, a place visited in dreams. In it lie an endless number of worlds, each hiding breathtaking beauty, terrible torment, or anywhere in between. Time is fluid, and parts may flit into and out of existence instantaneously. Whether it physically exists or not remains a mystery, but it is out there, somewhere – waiting for curious souls to venture into its unexplored depths.

<h3 align="center"> Catastropical Crisis </h3>

Cold. Death-cold, on the tip of his tongue.

Luce floundered up, choking on liquid. His eyes were blurred with tears. He felt heavy, like he had awoken from a long dream. As he ran a hand through his hair to wring out the water, he squinted open his eyes to take in his surroundings.

“Woah, what is this place?”

He could barely hear himself. The sound was muffled, like it was being swallowed as soon as it left his mouth.

“I–“

All he could see was endless grey in all directions. The same, still ocean, with a blanket of mist obscuring the air. He tried moving his leg, and watched the ripples vanish as quickly as they appeared.

Shivers raced down his spine. It was freezing.

<p align="center">〔~✦~〕</p>

The *Catastropical Lands*, as they came to be known, were the remnants of a planet that once faced a world-ending calamity. Torn apart yet not destroyed, a devastated labyrinthine mess was left behind. Mutated creatures, natural disasters and supernatural phenomena ravaged the surface, in precarious equilibrium with the little life that survived. Curiosity drew some to study the chaotic ecosystem; few ever survived to make it out.

After who knew how long wandering in the water, Luce approached the edge of a deserted island – no, a desert island. In place of the water was sand, a muted sickly pale colour under the faded sky. Trudging through it dragged at his skin.

> [!Note]
> *There is nothing restricting affinical powers to only humanoids. Any entity, animate or inanimate, corporeal or abstract, is capable of being infused with or itself harnessing affine. Hence, the term ‘being’ is used here to inclusively refer to any ‘affinityzable’ entity.*

In the world of affine, beings are bestowed a great power in their life – what is known as an ‘affinity’. It is, certainly, not an uncommon phenomenon, occuring in plenty of other worlds under the name of ‘magic’.

Among the affinitics were the few Elders who inherited the greatest – and indeed most dangerous – affinitys of all. They devoted themselves to upholding the peace and protection of their world against any potential threats, both internal and external. No one else deserved these powers more. Tales of the Elders’ courage and purity in the face of tragedy and despair passed down the generations as legends.

From the stellar heart of *Delphoenix Aestivale*, powered by the advanced technology of the Dyverse, *Aeternity Catastropical Supnauticator, the Affine Dyverse Construct* was born. Uniting the powers of time, nature and affine, it engaged Arkyrios in a devastating battle. Their world-shaking clash resounded throughout the dreamscape.

<h3 align="center"> Wisps of Creation </h3>

It had been like this for as long as he could remember. Each night, his mind would light up with spectacular visions so vivid and detailed, like entire lifetimes were passing by. Magnificent creatures came to life in worlds of breathtaking colour. He never felt more alive. Yet eventually, he would have to wake up. It was as if he had been submerged for a long time, and was pulling his head back out of the water. With each time, pulling out took more and more effort. Soon, it was the dreamscape that felt like home, reality reduced to a mere reflection of it. But waking up was inevitable, no matter how much he tried to cling on.

He couldn’t remember when she started appearing. It was a while before he started noticing her. She would lurk in the corner of his mind, stay by his side on his travels. Her presence was always there. The ghost of a touch, pinpricks dancing along his skin. He could feel her cries chasing after him, when nightmares sent him hurtling across the dreamscape. Her voice would echo in his head after he awoke, like a melody drawing him back into the dreamscape. Who was this faceless girl? He could never see her full figure, only ever a blur of iridescent hair rippling past, or a hazy silhouette half-shrouded in mist.

The closer he tried to approach, the further she appeared. And so, in time, he ceased trying, instead accepting her silent presence. It stayed like that, until she had vanished without him noticing.


<h3 align="center"> Lone Wanderer </h3>

In the deep night below a starry sky, a lone girl gazed up with the heavens glistening in her eyes. Her hair danced behind her, ethereal in the starlight. In her hands, she clasped a tiny locket, tinted lilac. It seemed as if she was searching for something. What did she see in that shining darkness?

The cold was bitter and unforgiving, but against her, it held back. She made her way onwards, never tiring, even as the night dragged on endlessly. The grass tickled at her frosted skin, but the feeling didn’t reach her head. It was only as the clouds closed in and she could no longer see the starlight that she finally collapsed on the ground, shivering in silence.

<p align="center">〔~✦~〕</p>

When he found her, her eyes were closed in a peaceful expression of detachment. He scooped her into his arms and sprinted back to his abode, laying her gently upon a large leaf that wrapped around her. Slowly, the cold drained from her body, and she arose to the sight of him washing up a meal.

His name was Souk. Tall, hunch-backed, with skin like the bark of wood and cut like rock, the odd weed twisting up a limb, arched feet with roots piercing into the ground, four tender fingers shaped like leaves on each hand, and the brightest pair of golden eyes filled with undeniable warmth. He lived on the outskirts of Supnautica, above the water, away from the others.

She never asked why. She never knew much about him at all. But he was there, always watching over her as she grew. Soon she ventured into the depths of Supnautica, and learnt their language, learnt to swim, learnt to breathe. And each day, she would return to their home, where Souk would open the door with his crooked smile, wrapping her in a rustled embrace. He never talked, but his eyes lit up her world.


<h3 align="center"> Infinite Possibility </h3>

> *Gwob?*  
> *Xwobo wob*  
> *om zgo*  
> *Awgo!*  

Who knew who had conceived the idea? It was, after all, an incredibly obscure thought... a world within a world, confined into the tiny space of a small blob. Somehow, this blob was alive, whatever you might mean by ‘alive’, and it would occasionally swallow something into its infinite depths, or spit something out.


<h3 align="center"> The Xen Constructs </h3>

Xistence is not stable. It never has been, and never will be; such is the nature of an existence born from the ever-fluctuating thoughts of ‘living’ beings.

Many things can lead to the collapse of a xerique. What’s worse is its corruption, an inexplicable unstoppable infection that eats away at the world and its continuity, until it shatters. Should this happen, fragments may, and almost certainly will, find their way into other xeriques. This may be harmless, only a minor disturbance that goes unnoticed. But with so many splinters, and so many worlds, disturbance is inevitable.

Disturbance leads to corruption, and what ensues is a chain reaction of corruption that tears away at xeriques on unprecedented levels. Indeed, there may be infinite xeriques, but beyond a breaking point, Xistence itself would collapse. Beyond that... is unknown.

Corruption is expected. Corruption can be contained. If minor enough, it can be contained within the xerique. But at the scale of entire xeriques?

The *Xen Constructs*, xeniqive ‘structures’, were created. They enclose corrupted xeriques, preventing the corruption from ever escaping. The worlds inside live on, degenerating further and morphing unrecognisably. To enter a Xen Construct would be beyond nightmarish. As it is, they are a necessary evil holding Xistence together. Not a perfect solution, but the one that works.
