## Aspects

| aspect | type | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :---- |
| This card’s original Level is treated as 0. | condition | Level 0 Tuners, let’s go |
| During your opponent’s turn (Quick Effect): You can send this card from your hand or field to the Graveyard; this turn, each time your opponent Special Summons a monster, they must banish 1 card from their hand, field, Extra Deck or Graveyard face-down. | quick | A potentially devastating handtrap effect. |
| You cannot activate other card effects the turn you use this effect. | lock condition | Severely restricted, so that the only interrupt the opponent will need to deal with is this one. Also, this inherently makes it a hard once per turn! |
