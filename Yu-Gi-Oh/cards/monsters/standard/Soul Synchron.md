## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| Tuner | property | Soul Tuning | |
| This card’s original Level is treated as 0. | condition | | A Level 0 Tuner, very unique! |
| You can Special Summon this card (from your Graveyard) by banishing 1 other ‘Soul’ card from your Graveyard, but you cannot Summon ‘Soul Synchron’ this way by banishing the same type of card (Monster/Spell/Trap) again this turn. | Summon condition | | That means potentially 4 Summons in one turn (a Normal Summon from the hand and 3 Special Summons from the Grave), though *Soul* Traps tend to be in short supply. |
| You can remove 1 Soul Counter from the field; this card gains 1 Level (max 11). | ignition | | It absorbs other souls, tuning them to bring out stronger Synchro Monsters. |
