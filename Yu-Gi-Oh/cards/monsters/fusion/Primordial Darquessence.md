## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| Must be Fusion Summoned by a ‘Darquess’ card, using the above materials that you have first Ritual or Fusion Summoned. | Summon condition | | |
| Unaffected by other card’s effects. | continuous | | |
| Cannot be targeted by card effects. | continuous | | Ok, it is insane, but I feel like it’s deserved here, since it’s so ludicrous to bring out. |
| Negate the effects of monsters whose original Attribute is not DARK. | continuous | | |
| Gains 100 ATK for each banished card. | continuous | | So yeah, it’s gonna take some setup to make this actually strong enough to bring out. Luckily, the entire *Darquess* archetype is about banishing cards! |
| Once per End Phase: Banish all other monsters on the field. | mandatory ignition | | |
| You can only Summon ‘Primordial Darquessence, Oblivion of Darquess’ once per Duel. | restriction | | Yeah, good luck pulling it off even once anyway. |
