## Trivia

- This card is an upgrade of [Ultimate Slayer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Slayer).
  - While it is more powerful in many ways, it is also less so in others.
    - This card banishes the target face-down instead of shuffling it into the Deck, and also locks the opponent from responding at all.
    - It can target Ritual Monsters, but not Pendulum Monsters.
    - Instead of sending from the Extra Deck to the Grave as its cost, it banishes a Monster from anywhere other than the Grave, which could be beneficial to certain Decks.
    - This card can only be activated once per turn.
- This card’s artwork is of [Ne Zha](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezha) and [Ao Bing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ao_Bing) from the 2019 film [哪吒之魔童降世](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_Zha_(2019_film)).
