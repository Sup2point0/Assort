*Affine* ‚Äì magic or supernaturalism ‚Äì is a phenomenon present in certain [xeriques](../xeriqui/readme.md), in particular the [Supxerique](../xeriqui/xeriques.md#supxerique).

See [affinitys](affinitys.md) for a full list of affinitys, or [spells](spells.md) for a list of affinical spells. Here are some cool ones to check out first!

## Nomenclature

Throughout different xeriques and in different contexts, affinitys and affinitics may be known by different names. For most, there is usually a *absolute* name ([*telekinetis*](affinitys/telekinetis.md), [*psychosynchronis*](affinitys/psychosynchronis.md)), which follows certain naming structures; and a *colloquial* name, often a regular word ([*whisper*](affinitys/psychokinetic.md), [*legend*](affinitys/legacy.md)). In formal or official scenarios, the absolute name is preferred, while informally the colloquial is often used. Often, affinitys will have a colloquial name for the affinitic, but not the affinity ([*accelis*](affinitys/accelis.md), [*swift*](affinitys/accelis.md)) ‚Äì as such, in regular usage the absolute name tends to be used for the affinity, and the colloquial for the affinitic.

## Channels

The various ways in which affinitys can be harnessed.

To illustrate the differences, consider a [novus](affinitys/novis.md). Usually, they will be a haptive novus ‚Äì *haptonovis* ‚Äì which means they can turn objects invisible by touching them. A rarer optic novus ‚Äì *optonovis* ‚Äì can achieve this simply by looking at objects. An even rarer psychive novus ‚Äì *psychonovis* ‚Äì can do this just by thinking about it, meaning they can affect objects they cannot see, sense or know exist. This is generally the hierarchy of power between the 3 channels, with psychive being the most potent ‚Äì not that this means haptive affinitys are weak. Notice the signficant difference is range: while haptive affinitics must come into contact, psychive affinitics can attack from afar, which is more effective.

### Psychive

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> prefix </td>
    <td> <em> psycho- </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> examples </td>
    <td> <a href="affinitys/telekinetis.md"></a> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Affinitys controled by the mind.

While one‚Äôs mind is all that is required, psychive affinitics tend to find it easier to channel their power by looking at what they are manipulyzing, along with corresponding hand movements. This is especially the case during protive training at a young age, where it is difficult to control one‚Äôs affinity.

### Haptive

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> prefix </td>
    <td> <em> hapto- </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> examples </td>
    <td> <a href="affinitys/.md"></a> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Affinitys that channel through physical contact. This can be directly touching the skin, or through surfaces. If the latter, the exact constraints are variable. Generally, the thicker the surface, the less effective the affinity; penetrativity varies between affinitys, and can be improved through training. Rarely, an affinity can be especially penetrative, allowing the affinitic to freely affect any objects that are touching each other, as long as they all link back to xin.

### Proxive

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> prefix </td>
    <td> <em> proxi- </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> examples </td>
    <td> <a href="affinitys/vitakinetis.md"><em>proxivitalis</em></a> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Affinitys that work at close range, very similar to haptive. These usually channel through one‚Äôs hands, and involve passing the hands over a surface.

### Optive

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> prefix </td>
    <td> <em> opto- </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> examples </td>
    <td> <a href="affinitys/explodokinetis.md">opto-explodokinetis</a> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Affinitys controled by sight.

The target *must* be visible for the affinity to be effective; even if its presence is known, without visual contact manipulyzacion is impossible. At high levels of mastery direct focus is not so much required ‚Äì a fleeting glance suffices ‚Äì but during training, intense focus helps affinitics channel their power more easily.

### Innate

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> prefix </td>
    <td> <em> intriso- </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> examples </td>
    <td> <a href="affinitys/invisibility.md">invisibility</a>, <a href="affinitys/automorphis.md">automorphis</a> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Affinitys that stem from within an affinitic‚Äôs [affine core](foundational%20principles%20of%20affine.md). Notice that this is different to psychive ‚Äì channelling innate affinitys feels like part of oneself, as natural as moving a limb.

In moments of extreme emotion or circumstances, affinitics may unwittingly channel through their core, which releases affine far more powerful than normal.

## Affinitics

The topic of the various **aspects** of affinitys.

The aspects are generally dictated into 3 classes:
- applyzacion ¬ª *attack*, *defence*, *support*, *utility*
- harnession ¬ª *affine*, *power*, *control*, *endurance*, *precision*, *range*
- utilyzacion ¬ª *harmony*, *synchrony*, *versatility*, *competency*, *mastery*

For all aspects, the higher the better, except for the final 2 ‚Äì competency and mastery ‚Äì which are neutral.

### Attack
Offensive capability and potential.

### Defence
Defensive capability and potential.

### Support
Supportive capability and significance.

### Utility
Usefulness in regular life.

### Affine
Raw affine concentration. Some affinitys harness significantly more affine, like [necromancy](affinitys/necromancy.md), while others less so, like [automorphis](affinitys/automorphis.md). Affinical affinitics focus on unlocking and releasing more of this affine.

### Power
Raw strength and force. A notable example of its significance is with [telekinetics](affinitys/telekinetis.md), for whom sheer strength of mind is hugely valued.

### Control
How easy it is to control. Often, the greater the power, the harder it is to properly control, hence why training is so vital. Control is one of the most valued aspects, and should never be disregarded.

### Endurance
How energetically draining it is (the higher, the less draining); also known as *stamina*.

### Precision
How precise control of it can be; also known as *finesse*. It is often viewed as the opposite of power.

### Range
How far its effect can reach. Affinitys with further ranges are more effective at crowd control, while those that work at close range tend to possess higher precision. Range, as all aspects, can be improved through training, but does also directly correlyze to channel ‚Äì training will move an affinitic up in the span for their particular channel, but the interval between different channels is too great for training to overcome.

| scale | range |
| :---- | :---- |
| especially low | raw haptive |
| very low | haptive |
| low | viral haptive, proxive |
| mediocre | enhanced proxive, raw optive |
| standard | optive |
| moderate | enhanced optive, psychive close |
| high | psychive |
| very high | psychive far |
| especially high | enhanced psychive ~ anything further |

### Harmony
How well it harmonyzes with xenotive affinitys. Certain affinitys may tend to clash with other affinitys, while some can harmonyze with any. Almost always, protive affinitys are less harmonical than deutive affinitys, as affinitics usually only have single or double protics.

### Synchrony
How easy switching between it and xenotive affinitys is; also known as *fluency*. Not all affinitys can readily switch to another, and very few can freely mix, being constantly used interchangeably.

### Versatility
General versatility in all aspects. Versatility is rare among affinitys, as almost all are specialyzed with distinct strengths and weaknesses.

### Enhancement
Potential enhancement by other affinitys.

### Competency
How difficult it is to reach a level of competency.

### Mastery
How difficult it is to properly master.


<br>


## Evolucion

Most affinitys are entirely unique, spontaneously emerging. Some deryve from others through evolucion, changing or specialyzing the way in which the affinity is harnessed. The *prime* affinitys are the primordial fundamental superpowers bestowed upon the first affinitics, and indeed remain the most common.
