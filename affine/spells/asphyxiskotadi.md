## Articulation

As a dark curse, it requires powerful intent to activyze. An intense initial strike – not darting, but drawn out – initialyzes the spell, followed by small vicious sweeps that feed the darkness.

## Effects

Unlike other spells affected by drive, with the Darkchoke curse emotion plays no role, only intent. As such, both corrupted and pure souls can harness it with equal deadliness.

The initial strike can have varying effects for different victens, usually a (quasi-paralyzing) jolt of anxiety, panic, or fear; pain is often perceived.
