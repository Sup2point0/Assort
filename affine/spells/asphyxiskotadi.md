## Articulation

As a dark curse, it requires powerful intent to activate. An intense initial strike – not darting, but drawn out – initialises the spell, followed by small vicious sweeps that feed the darkness. 


<br>


## Effects

Unlike other spells affected by drive, with the Darkchoke curse emotion plays no role, only intent. As such, both corrupted and pure souls can harness it with equal deadliness.

The initial strike can have varying effects for different victims, usually a (quasi-paralysing) jolt of anxiety, panic, or fear; pain is often perceived.
