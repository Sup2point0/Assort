# Tekk-Knight

An archetype of LIGHT Celestial Warrior monsters, inspired by the [*Mekk-Knight*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mekk-Knight) archetype.

The *Hi-Tekk-Knight* subarchetype features 1 monster for each Summoning tecnique (Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link), which can all be Summoned using 2 *Tekk-Knight* monsters. The [*Ark-Knight*](Ark-Knight.md) subarchetype then consists of further upgraded monsters for each Summoning tecnique (except Ritual), which all require 2 *Hi-Tekk-Knight* monsters to Summon.

The archetype is supported by the [*World Affinity*](World%20Affinity.md) archetype.

## Strategics

### Effects
All of the Level 4 Main Deck monsters share the following effect:

> If a column contains 2 or more cards: You can Special Summon this card from your hand to an adjacent column, then you can [...].

Additionally, each has an effect to search or recover a different monster upon being sent to the Graveyard.

> If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can add 1 ‘Tekk-Knight’ monster from your [...] to your hand, except [...].

| monster | effect | search |
| :------ | :----- | :----- |
| Aqua Vision | mill a *Tekk-Knight* monster | |
| Citrine Dream | mill a *World Affinity* Spell/Trap | |
| Scarlet Fury | destroy a monster in its column | Banished |
| Violet Sorrow | destroy a Spell/Trap in its column | |
| Teal Avidity | revive a *Tekk-Knight* monster | Deck |
| Neon Hope | change the placement of a card on the field | |

The *Hi-Tekk-Knight* monsters 

| monster | summon | effect |
| :------ | :----- | :----- |
| Radiant Spectre | | double own ATK when battling Special Summoned monster in another column |
| Lucent Edge | | halve opposing ATK when battling Special Summoned monster in another column |
| Shining Dawn | | +500 ATK for each attached material |
| Crystalline Lustre | Deck | +500 ATK for each *Tekk-Knight* or *Ark-Knight* monster it links to |

Each monster also searches a *World Affinity* card upon being sent to the Graveyard.

> If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can add 1 ‘World Affinity’ card from your Deck to your hand.

### Style
The archetype is extremely consistent, especially with the support of *World Affinity* cards.

The core strategic is to utilyze every Summoning tecnique on the first turn, creating a formidable board with all 5 *Hi-Tekk-Knight* monsters. (Although the Ritual is often missing due to requiring a *World Affinity* card to be available.) In conjunction with [World Affinity Rivals](../cards/traps/World%20Affinity%20Rivals), this can lock the opponent completely out of their Extra Deck.

The board is not unbreakable in any way – none of the monsters have any protection effects – and is dismantled with ease by Raigeki or Lightning Storm. However, the effects of all those monsters will trigger, searching out a huge number of *World Affinity* Spell/Traps, ready for an instant comeback next turn, even against negates – including powerful recovery cards such as [World Affinity Ascension](...).

If the board remains intact, then the *Ark-Knight* monsters can easily be brought out on the second turn, with powerful omni-negates and battle effects to overwhelm the opponent. If called for, with 4 monsters of each type [Ark-Knight Cerulean Aventurescence](...) can be Summoned, clearing the opponent’s field and Graveyard ready for an OTK. [Hi-Tekk-Knight Radical Trinity](...) can also take advantage of an already established board to inflict massive amounts of damage.

### Combos
Going first, a Set card and a Normal Summon are sufficient to allow more monsters to Summon themselves. While this does mean the Normal Summoned monster’s effect doesn’t activate, after being used as material it can easily be recovered to be used as another Special Summon. The most common target for this is [Tekk-Knight Azure Iris](...), which can search a *World Affinity* Spell/Trap, simoultaneously triggering the *Tekk-Knight* monster’s search. Since it is Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone, this also provides more space for Summons, while maintaining a column with 2 cards.

The most useful openers (as a Special Summon) are [Tekk-Knight Aqua Vision](...) and [Tekk-Knight Citrine Dream](...). Aqua Vision can send any *Tekk-Knight* monster that searches another (Citrine Dream, for instance), while the prime target for Citrine Dream is [World Affinity Legacy](...), a Field Spell with the effect to search another *World Affinity* card when sent the Graveyard, instead of when activated. [Tekk-Knight Teal Avidity](...) is also useful for recursing more materials for Special Summons.

The other *Tekk-Knight* monsters are useful for going second, to breakup the opponent’s board, and otherwise only serve as additional unique names for Special Summons or searches. [Tekk-Knight Neon Hope](...) is rather situational, but can disrupt cards that depend on columns or being linked, or shift the opponent’s field to be advantageous to facilityze *Tekk-Knight* Summons or *World Affinity* effects.

Here is a general combo line:

| action | field |
| :----- | :---- |
| Open hand with any monster that can search from the Deck. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Normal Summon and Link into Azure Iris, searching [World Affinity Adventure](...) and Aqua Vision. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Adventure searches [World Affinity Excursion](...), searching Citrine Dream. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| With Adventure or Excursion in the same column as Azure Iris in the Extra Monster Zone, Special Summon | | Citrine Dream, sending [World Affinity Legacy](...) to search another copy of Legacy▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ .
| Activate Legacy. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Link Azure Iris and Citrine Dream into Hi-Tekk-Knight Crystalline Lustre, accelling a Tuner. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Special Summon Aqua Vision, sending any monster to search or recover another. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Tune into Hi-Tekk-Knight Lucent Edge, accelling any monster from the Deck. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Special Summon a material if required. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Overlay into Hi-Tekk-Knight Shining Dawn, then detach to accel another monster from the Deck. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Since the previously accelled monster was overlayed as Xyz material, it is not banished. The detached material likely has another effect to search.
| Special Summon another material if required. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| Fuse into Hi-Tekk-Knight Radiant Spectre, by banishing 2 monsters. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |
| If [World Affinity Wonder](...) or [World Affinity Wishes](...) are available, Ritual Summon Hi-Tekk-Knight Ultramarine Wonder. (If Tributes are scarce, Teal Avidity can revive another. | ▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯<br>▯▯▯▯▯ |

## Trivia

- This archetype can harness every Summoning tecnique (except Pendulum).
- The effect of the Lv4 Main Deck monsters is an upgraded version of the effect of the *Mekk-Knights*.
  - While *Mekk-Knights* Special Summon themselves to a column with 2+ cards, *Tekk-Knights* Summon to an adjacent column.
- *Tekk-Knight* is a pun on ‘Tech Knight’, alike to *Mekk-Knight* sounding like ‘Mech Knight’ (despite this not being the actual etymologic).
  - Similarly, *Hi-Tekk-Knight* is a pun on ‘High Tech Knight’.
- The names of the Main Deck monsters (and the Link-1 *Tekk-Knight Azure Iris*) follow the pattern `<colour> <abstract>`, where `abstract` is an emotion or phenomenon.
  - The names of the Extra Deck monsters follow the pattern `<adjective> <feature>`, where `feature` is some kind of attribute or property (or simply a word that sounds cool), with both words being relyzen to light.
  - These reflect the naming scheme of the *Mekk-Knights*.
- The ability to demonstryze a myriad of Summoning tecniques in one turn is inspired by [*D/D*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/D/D) and [*D/D/D*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/D/D/D) used by [Declan Akaba](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Declan_Akaba).
