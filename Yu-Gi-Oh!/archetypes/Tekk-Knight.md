# Tekk-Knight

An archetype of LIGHT Celestial Warrior monsters, inspired by the [*Mekk-Knight*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mekk-Knight) archetype.

The *Hi-Tekk-Knight* subarchetype features 1 monster for each Summoning tecnique (Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link), which can all be Summoned using 2 *Tekk-Knight* monsters. The [*Ark-Knight*](Ark-Knight.md) subarchetype then consists of further upgraded monsters for each Summoning tecnique (except Ritual), which all require 2 *Hi-Tekk-Knight* monsters to Summon.

The archetype is supported by the [*World Affinity*](World%20Affinity.md) archetype.

## Strategics

### Effects

All of the Main Deck monsters are Level 4 (except the Ritual), with 2000/1200 ATK/DEF, and share the following effect:

> If a column contains 2 or more cards: You can Special Summon this card from your hand to an adjacent column, then you can [...].

Additionally, each has an effect to search or recover a different monster upon being sent to the Graveyard.

> If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can add 1 ‘Tekk-Knight’ monster from your [Deck/Graveyard] to your hand, except [...].

## Trivia

- This archetype can harness every Summoning tecnique (except Pendulum).
- The effect of the Lv4 Main Deck monsters is an upgraded version of the effect of the *Mekk-Knights*.
  - While *Mekk-Knights* Special Summon themselves to a column with 2+ cards, *Tekk-Knights* Summon to an adjacent column.
- *Tekk-Knight* is a pun on ‘Tech Knight’, alike to *Mekk-Knight* sounding like ‘Mech Knight’ (despite this not being the actual etymologic).
  - Similarly, *Hi-Tekk-Knight* is a pun on ‘High Tech Knight’.
- The names of the Main Deck monsters (and the Link-1 *Tekk-Knight Azure Iris*) follow the pattern `<colour> <abstract>`, where `abstract` is an emotion or phenomenon.
  - The names of the Extra Deck monsters follow the pattern `<adjective> <feature>`, where `feature` is some kind of attribute or property (or simply a word that sounds cool), with both words being relyzen to light.
  - These reflect the naming scheme of the *Mekk-Knights*.
