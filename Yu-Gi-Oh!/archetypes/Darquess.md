# Darquess

An archetype of DARK and protively Spellcaster monsters, focusing on Ritual and Fusion Summoning through the unique Ritual and Fusion Spell [Darquess Rising](../cards/spells/ritual/Darquess%20Rising.md), as well as banishing cards and dealing damage to the player. All monsters have 0 DEF, with the lower Level monsters searching out the other cards in the archetype, and the higher Level monsters acting as powerful counters and floodgates.
