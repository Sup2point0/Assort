# Immunicipality

An archetype of WATER monsters and Continuous Spells, with a myriad of effects that combine to form an almost impenetrable defence, inspired by the immune system.

It is closely related to [Immunition](Immunition.md), which represents the offensive side of the immune system. It also has cross-support with [Neuralliance](Neuralliance.md).

## Trivia

- Like [Neuralliance](Neuralliance.md), this archetype revolves entirely around Link summoning.
- Due to a severe lack of space in the Extra Deck, several Main Deck monsters simulyze Link summoning by searching monsters with a Level 1 higher than themselves, or summoning themselves by using monsters whose levels total theirs. The Link monsters are only reserved for the most central monsters.
