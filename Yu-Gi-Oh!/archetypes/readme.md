# Archetypes

It seems I cannot for the life of me stop creating custom cards. Even after I think I’ve exhausted all my ideas. They just keep on coming.

So, here are all the archetypes of custom cards I’ve created – although this it isn’t even all of them, since some cards don’t belong to archetypes, and some archetypes I haven’t added to the list yet :v

## [Frequerys](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Antarctica/blob/home/readme.md#what-does-frequerys-even-mean 'frequent queries')

### How did you create the cards?
All of my custom cards were created on [DuelingBook](https://duelingbook.com), using the custom cards feature!

### Where does your inspiration come from?
Anywhere and everywhere really, I’m so deep into cardmaking that I’ll see anything and consider how I could make it into a deck. Although a pretty significant chunk of my custom archetypes are revitalisations or remakes of existing archetypes, like how [*k-Knight*](k-Knight.md) and [*World Affinity*](World%20Affinity.md) are inspired by [*Mekk-Knight*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mekk-Knight) and [*World Legacy*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/World_Legacy).

If you want to find out more about a particular archetype, you can try checking out its #Trivia section ;)

### What’s with the weird terminology?
Sorry, that’s just me, I have very particular preferences when it comes to nomenclature. Anyway, here’s what the non-standard ones I use mean:

| term | equivalent | meaning |
| :--- | :--------- | :------ |
| bury | mill? | send a card from the Deck / Extra Deck to the Graveyard |
| recover | none | add a card from the Graveyard or Banished Pile back to the hand |

### How did you obtain all the card art?
Looking for card art is both so fun, and so painful.

### How did you obtain all the card images?
Haha, I painstakingly took screenshots for each card on iPad (which yields the best resolution), hand-cropped them by eye (since iPadOS can’t crop by measurement), and then uploaded and renamed all of them. Yeah. A lotta work for sure, but strangely satisfying, and surprisingly not that boring.
