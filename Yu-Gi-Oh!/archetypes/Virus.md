## Strategics

Each Deck virus Trap wrecks the opponent’s Deck in a particular way. The ‘Deck D... Virus’ Traps destroy cards in the Deck, while the ‘Deck E... Virus’ Traps banish cards in the Graveyard and Extra Deck. If unleashed in tandem, the opponent’s Deck can be ruined in a single strike.

When dueling a new opponent, the main strategy is secrecy and concealment. All of the monsters are entirely defenceless and only serve as bait for the Traps. The air of secrecy can be kept by other effects that help to protect or conceal cards, such as [Tendrils of Concealing Darkness]() and [Pot of Secrecy]().

The Virus archetype synergyzes well with the [Dead-Eyes](Dead-Eyes.md) archetype, specifically the ‘Doom’ Xyz Dragon monsters in the Extra Deck, since those require DARK Level 1 monsters, which are exactly what the monsters are.
