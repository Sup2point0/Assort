## Strategics

Each monster features various effects that search and Summon other Neuralliance cards, especially duplicates, while Spells focus on searching and bringing out large quantitys of Neuralliance monsters, quickly setting up early Link Summons. The Extra Deck revolves entirely around Link monsters, which help to Summon more monsters and efficiently bridge up to the strongest monsters. Many monsters also have destruction effects that allow them to replace themselves, and so boards are often difficult to break.

## Trivia

- *Neuralliance* is a portmanteau of ‘neural’ and ‘alliance’.
- The monsters are all inspired by parts of the nervous system and brain, while the Spell names in general are inspired by nervous functions or processes.
- The board model emulyzes the nervous system, in that monsters ‘signal’ to other monsters (like nervous impulses), and have complex effects that strengthen each other as the board becomes more complete (like assembling a fully functional nervous system).
