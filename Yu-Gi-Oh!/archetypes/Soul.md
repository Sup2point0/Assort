## Overview

*Soul* is a highly diverse archetype, with plenty of niche or flavour cards that don’t fit into a particular category. All of the Monsters have either 0 ATK or 0 DEF, with the other value ending in 50, and many of the low-Level Monsters are Spirits.

### Tuners
[Soul Synchron](../cards/standard/Soul%20Synchron.md) is the archetypal Tuner, unique in having an original Level of 0. It can, however, raise its own Level up to Lv11 by absorbing [Soul Counters](#Soul-Counters) from anywhere on the field, which allows [higher Level Synchro Monsters](#High-Level-Synchro-Monsters) to be accessed more easily. This card is vital for Synchro Summons, so can easily Special Summon itself multiple times in one turn – although *Soul* Traps tend to be in short supply.

Tuning it with [Soul Shard](#Soul-Shard) brings out [Soul Shard Synchron](../cards/synchro/Soul%20Shard%20Synchron.md), the archetypal Synchro Tuner. It is Lv0 like Soul Synchron, but is unique in that it replaces its original Level with the total Level of its Materials. It can then alter this Level by burying a non-Tuner *Soul* Monster, which also happens to be a built-in search.

    <td> by removing Soul Counters from the field </td>
    <td> by burying a non-Tuner <em>Soul</em> Monster from the Deck or Extra Deck </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Ritual Monsters
There are 2 Lv7 Ritual Monsters, [Soul Swordsman]() and [Soul Dragon](), which serve as the Ritual aces of the archetype. They are quite similar, with moderate ATK, and non-targeting soft removal trigger effect that activates whenever a *Soul* Ritual or Synchro Monster is Special Summoned (note that this doesn’t need to be a proper Ritual or Synchro Summon, or even be performed by the player themselves).

> If this card or another ‘Soul’ Ritual or Synchro Monster is Special Summoned: You can {…} 1 card from the field or either player’s Graveyard {…}.

They can also protect themselves from destruction by banishing a *Soul* Monster from the Grave instead.

> If this card would be destroyed, you can banish 1 ‘Soul’ Monster from your Graveyard instead.

You might have noticed these are Tuners – that’s because by tuning them with [Soul Shard](), they can evolve into their upgraded *Soul Shard* [Synchro forms](), [Soul Shard Swordsman]() and [Soul Shard Dragon]()!

{{~}}

[Soul Elder]() is the Lv10 Ritual boss of the archetype, with a few devastating effects. It negates the effects of all Monsters without a Level (everywhere, not just on the field), which synergises perfectly with the rest of the archetype, since it exclusively utilises Synchro Monsters (alongside the Fusion Monster [Vengeance Vanguard]()). This also doesn’t impact the [Tuners](), since they do ‘have a Level’, only that their Level is 0.

The Monster also grants the protection effect of the [Synchro Aces]() to all *Soul* cards the player controls, preventing their destruction by banishing a *Soul* card from the Grave. Should a *Soul* card be banished – either through this effect, or to activate another *Soul* card’s effect, since the archetype fulfils this regularly – it can then banish an opponent’s card too.

## Trivia

- [Vengeance Vanguard](../cards/monsters/fusion/Vengeance%20Vanguard.md) is the final boss of the archetype, but is not in the archetype itself.
- The 0 ATK or DEF of Monsters reflects their fragility and volatility.
- A significant chunk of the art is sourced from [*League of Legends*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends).
- This is one of the first custom archetypes I created.
  - It originally formed a deck called *Vengeance* with the [Ninjato](Ninjato.md) archetype, before I decided to split them so each could focus on their individual playstyle.
