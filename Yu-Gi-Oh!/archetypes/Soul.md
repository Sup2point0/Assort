## Trivia

- [Vengeance Vanguard](../cards/fusion/Vengeance%20Vanguard.md) is the ultimate Monster of the archetype, but is not in the archetype itself.
- The 0 ATK or DEF of Monsters reflects their fragility and volatility.
- A significant chunk of the art is sourced from League of Legends.
- This is one of the first custom archetypes I created.
  - It originally formed a deck with the [Ninjato](Ninjato.md) archetype, before I decided to split them so each could focus on their individual playstyle.
