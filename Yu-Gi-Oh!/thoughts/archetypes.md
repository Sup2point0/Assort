Just laying out my thoughts on all the archetypes in *Yu-Gi-Oh* I’ve faced, watched and understood throughout my time playing. Being such a prolific custom card creator and having created so many archetypes, I find I hold perhaps quite different perspectives to the rest of the playerbase, caring significantly more about design tropes and principles.

## Branded

I remember when I first saw these cards all over *Master Duel* – this was just about when I was getting back into the game, so they were totally unfamiliar to me – and thinking, *’damn, cool names, cool art, cool cards’*. It was a wonderful kind of blissful ignorance.[^bliss-feel] While I thought the cards were cool, I really didn’t like how the deck functioned at first. A very linear and efficient combo, just felt kinda scummy for such low effort.

As I’ve discovered the rest of the archetype though, and most importantly delved into its rich lore (courtesy of [Golden Nova Yu-Gi-Oh<sup>↗</sup>](https://youtube.com/@GoldenNovaYugioh)), I unknowingly came to love it. I still don’t play it, and don’t plan on playing it, but I absolutely adore the characters and art and the magnificent inter-weaving story. Can’t wait for part 2. I kinda hold an uncharged[^uncharged] respect for its efficiency and resiliency (for me at least, it’s one of the quintessential modern decks), and I do like that its combos have become more diverse and non-linear with the addition of all the new cards. Also, Branded is a blast to duel against.[^duel]

[^bliss-feel]: I’m sure you know the feeling. When something is fresh and unfamiliar and you’re navigating it for the first time. Everyone longs to have it back afterwards.
[^uncharged]: As in, kinda neutral, not really charged with any intense feeling.
[^branded-duel]: I’m lookin’ at you, Drytron &lt;3

## Kashtira

Never have I ever hated an archetype as much as this, I don’t think. Purely from a design perspective, it’s way. too. overtuned. – and while that may not directly translate into power, it certainly makes the cards appear frustratingly unfair (at least to me).

The 3 Main Deck Monsters can all easily Special Summon themselves (materials – check), search a card (consistency – check), and act as interaction (disruption – check). None of those individual effects are problematic, but all 3 on a single card? Across 3 monsters!?

Arise-Heart literally reads like a custom card.[^arise-heart]

[^arise-heart]: Can confirm.

## Tearlaments

Firstly, I really love the art. Genuinely some of the most aesthetically brilliant Yu-Gi-Oh cards to ever exist.[^tear-art] The colour palette is stunning. Also, the name is incredible. Triple pun, just... perfection.

[^tear-art]: Also waifu material, ofc :v

With that out the way... hot take here, I actually really like the way the archetype is designed, with the exception of a few cards.
