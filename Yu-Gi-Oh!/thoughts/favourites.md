    <td> <a href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Valuable_Book_EX_2_card_storylines">Abyss</a> </td>
    <td> The characters / archetypes involved are all so diverse and memorable, the names are all top-notch (how d’you get more intense than *Branded*), and ofc I absolutely love the storyline of Albaz and Ecclesia. There’s something about the artstyle as well which is so perfectly dramatic, but at the same time has a sorta ‘homely’ feeling which I really love (actually, this is a really weird way to describe it) – I think <a target="_blank" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/New_Frontier">New Frontier<sup>↗</sup></a> captures that really well. </td>
