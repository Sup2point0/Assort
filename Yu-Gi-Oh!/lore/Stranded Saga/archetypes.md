# Archetypes

The archetypes of the Stranded Saga can broadly be divided into 2 halves – protagonist and antagonist – where the cards in each archetype are designed to sometimes work together within their half, and sometimes counter the opposite the other half, whether directly or indirectly. Not all cards have overlapping or synergising effects, allowing each archetype to maintain its own character, but the links and crossovers between them enables the potential of mixing them interchangeably into a single cohesive deck.

## Stranded
This synergy is mainly enabled by the central *Stranded* archetype, which connects the archetypes with its many cross-archetypal cards (like [Catastropical Island of the Stranded](...)) and multi-archetype support (like [Stranded Fusion](...)). Most of the main characters belong primarily to this archetype, and the Spell/Traps detail most of the significant events in the storyline.

## Aetern
An archetype of LIGHT and DARK Galaxy Fusion and Xyz Monsters, focusing on Fusion Summoning non-combative Monsters through fusing Spell/Traps instead of Monsters, somewhat inspired by the [*Runick*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Runick) archetype. It has no Main Deck Monsters, even having many cards that restrict the player from Special Summoning Main Deck Monsters. The archetype includes the subarchetypes *Aeternal* and *Aeternity*, with the latter being reserved for a select few power cards.
