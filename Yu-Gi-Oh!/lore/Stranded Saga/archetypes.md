# Archetypes

> [!Note]
> It would be ridiculous to create all the cards for all the archetypes in the Stranded Saga (even for me), so most are documented here instead of their own separate file in [archetypes](../../archetypes).

The archetypes of the Stranded Saga can broadly be divided into 2 halves – protagonist and antagonist – where the cards in each archetype are designed to sometimes work together within their half, and sometimes counter the opposite the other half, whether directly or indirectly. Not all cards have overlapping or synergising effects, allowing each archetype to maintain its own character, but the links and crossovers between them enables the potential of mixing them interchangeably into a single cohesive deck.

## Stranded

> See [*Stranded*](../../archetypes/Stranded.md) for more.

This synergy is mainly enabled by the central *Stranded* archetype, which connects the archetypes with its many cross-archetypal cards (like [Catastropical Island of the Stranded](...)) and multi-archetype support (like [Stranded Fusion](...)). Most of the main characters belong primarily to this archetype, and the Spell/Traps detail most of the significant events in the storyline.


<br>


## Excursion

An archetype including the *Epic Excursion* Continuous Spells, and *Endless Excursion* Continuous Traps, representing the different locations visited by the characters in the storyline.

They share the following effect.

> You can only control 1 “Excursion” card during the End Phase.

This gives the unique mechanic of being able to activate multiple *Excursion* cards in one turn (particularly relevant if an *Endless Excursion* Trap is activated while the player already controls an *Epic Excursion* Spell), but needing to sacrifice them at the end of the turn.

| card | supports |
| :--- | :------- |
| Endless Excursion into the Dreamscape | *Walker* |
| Epic Excursion to the Catastropical Peaks | *Catastropical* |
| Endless Excursion into Ancient Aeterra 
| Epic Excursion to the Affine Lakes | *Affin* |
| Epic Exursion to the Supnautican Depths | *Supnautic* |
| Epic Excursion to the Ever-Shining Skies | *Delphoenix* |


<br>


## Incursion

An archetype of Traps and Quick-Play Spells, countering the *Excursion* archetype. Most of the cards also belong to one or more of the antagonist archetypes. These represent some of the moments where those archetypes appear or attack.

| card | supports |
| :--- | :------- |

## Aetern

An archetype of LIGHT and DARK Galaxy Fusion and Xyz Monsters, focusing on Fusion Summoning non-combative Monsters through fusing Spell/Traps instead of Monsters, somewhat inspired by the [*Runick*](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Runick) archetype.
