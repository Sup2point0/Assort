## Prologue – “Derealising Descent”

> *And we could only gaze in awe*  
> *Upon those sights born from our thoughts*  
> *never seen*  
> *Entranced at what our minds could dream*  

It had been like this for as long as he could remember. Each night, his mind would be filled with spectacular visions, seemingly real and unreal at the same time, so vivid and detailed as if entire lifetimes were passing. Dreams, as we know them.

Yet eventually, he would have to wake up. It felt like he had been submerged for a long time, and was pulling his head back out of the water. Each time, it became harder to go back. Soon, it was the dreamscape that felt like home, reality reduced to a mere reflection of it.
