### Forsaken Memory
A person stood in his way.  
“What brings you here?” their soft voice carried.  
“I... can’t remember,” said Luce, taking a step towards them.  
“You can’t enter,” they breathed.  
“Why not?”  
A moment passed. “Not yet.” Their face was still concealed.  
“Where do I go, then?” Luce asked, tentatively.  
They turned their back to him. “You only have to follow your heart.”

### Wisps of Creation
It had been like this for as long as he could remember. Each night, his mind would light up with spectacular visions so vivid and detailed, like entire lifetimes were passing by. Magnificent creatures came to life in worlds of breathtaking colour. He never felt more alive. Yet eventually, he would have to wake up. It was as if he had been submerged for a long time, and was pulling his head back out of the water. With each time, pulling out took more and more effort. Soon, it was the dreamscape that felt like home, reality reduced to a mere reflection of it. But waking up was inevitable, no matter how much he tried to cling on.

He couldn’t remember when she started appearing. It was a while before he started noticing her. She would lurk in the corner of his mind, stay by his side on his travels. Her presence was always there. The ghost of a touch, pinpricks dancing along his skin. He could feel her cries chasing after him, when nightmares sent him hurtling across the dreamscape. Her voice would echo in his head after he awoke, like a melody drawing him back into the dreamscape. Who was this faceless girl? He could never see her full figure, only ever a blur of iridescent hair rippling past, or a hazy silhouette half-shrouded in mist.

### Lone Wanderer
In the deep night below a starry sky, a lone girl gazed up with the heavens glistening in her eyes. What did she see in that shining darkness?

The cold was bitter and unforgiving, but against her, it held back. She made her way onwards, never tiring, even as the night dragged on endlessly. The grass tickled at her frosted skin, but the feeling didn’t reach her head. It was only as the clouds closed in and she could no longer see the starlight that she finally collapsed on the ground, shivering in silence.

When he found her, her eyes were closed in a peaceful expression of detachment. He scooped her into his arms and sprinted back to his abode, laying her gently upon a large leaf that wrapped around her body. Slowly, the cold drained from her body, and she arose to the sight of him washing up a meal.

His name was Souk. Tall, hunch-backed, with skin like the bark of wood and cut like rock, the odd weed twisting up a limb, arched feet with roots piercing into the ground, four tender fingers shaped like leaves on each hand, and the brightest pair of golden eyes filled with undeniable warmth. He lived on the outskirts of Supnautica, above the water, away from the others.

She never asked why. She never knew much about him at all. But he was there, always watching over her as she grew. Soon she ventured into the depths of Supnautica, and learnt their language, learnt to swim, learnt to breathe. And each day, she would return to their home, where Souk would open the door with his crooked smile, wrapping her in a rustled embrace. He never talked, but his eyes lit up the room.

### Infinite Possibility
&emsp; &emsp; *Gwob?*  
&emsp; &emsp; *Xwobo wob*  
&emsp; &emsp; *om zgo*  
&emsp; &emsp; *Awgo!*  

Who knew who had conceived the idea? It was, after all, an incredibly obscure thought... a world within a world, confined into the tiny space of a small blob. Somehow, this blob was alive, whatever you might mean by ‘alive’, and it would occasionally swallow something into its infinite depths, or spit something out.
