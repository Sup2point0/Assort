# Problem-Solving Super Simple and Compact Custom Card Text

Card text in *Yu-Gi-Oh!* is wonderfully written (in that it reads like regular text, easily allowing players to understand what it does) ...but at the same time is also horrendously cluttered and inefficient for playing a card game, especially one on tiny pieces of cardboard.

And so, here’s *PSSSCCCT*, the successor to PSCT, which I exclusively utilyze on DuelingBook to allow the opponent to far more easily interpret and keep track of what all my cards do.


<br>


## Rationale

There have been some great changes to PSCT in the past – for instance, simply stating ‘inflict piercing battle damage’ instead explaining how piercing battle damage works – but the thing is, they just don’t *do* enough.
