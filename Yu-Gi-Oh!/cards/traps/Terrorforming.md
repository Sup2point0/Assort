## Trivia

- This cardâ€™s name is a pun on [Terraforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming), since it is a parody of the [Terraforming](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Terraforming) card.
  - This is reflected in its art which depicts a black hole, since a black hole would terraform celestial bodies near it, and induce terror in anything alive.
