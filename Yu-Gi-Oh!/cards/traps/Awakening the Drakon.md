## Trivia

- This card is a parody of the card [Waking the Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Waking_the_Dragon).
  - Unlike Waking the Dragon, which Special Summons from the Deck or Extra Deck, this card Special Summons from the Extra Deck or Graveyard.
    - Importantly, this prevents it from being negated by [Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ash_Blossom_%26_Joyous_Spring).
