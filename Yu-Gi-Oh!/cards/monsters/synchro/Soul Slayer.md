## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| ? ATK | attack | ~ | |
| Must be Synchro Summoned with the above materials. | Summon condition | | *Soul* really loves this Summoning condition, doesn’t it? |
| This card’s original ATK and DEF become half your opponent’s LP and half your LP, respectively. | continuous | | I absolutely love this effect. It just has so much *flavour*. |
| Once per turn: You can pay half your LP and send 1 ‘Soul’ monster from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard; inflict damage equal to the ATK of 1 monster your opponent controls, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to that inflicted damage until the end of next turn. | ignition | | Of course, since the opponent’s just lost LP this card’s original ATK will go down – so it just boosts itself right back up again! |
