| Must first be Synchro Summoned with the above materials. | Summon condition | |
| Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can banish 1 ‘Soul’ card from your Graveyard; flip all cards your opponent controls face-down. | quick | Yeah, that’s gonna hurt. |
| Once per turn, if your ‘Soul’ card(s) is targeted by a card effect (Quick Effect): You can make a card(s) on your opponent’s field or in their Graveyard become the target(s) instead. | quick | Well, targeting effects just became a lot more dangerous. To the opponent themselves. |
