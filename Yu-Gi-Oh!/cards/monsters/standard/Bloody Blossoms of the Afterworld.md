| aspect | type | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :---- |
| This card’s original Level is treated as 0. | condition | Level 0 Tuners, let’s go |
| Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. | Summon condition | |
| Must be Special Summoned (from your hand) by Tributing 1 or more monsters on the field with different types (Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link). | Summon condition | Aw yeah, the field clearance. |
| You cannot Normal Summon/Set during the turn you Summon ‘Bloody Blossoms of the Afterworld’ this way. | lock condition | |
| Cannot be Tributed or used as Special Summon material. | condition | Importantly, this means you can’t just use it as material once you Summon it – it’s essentially a dead body once on the field. |
| There can only be 1 ‘Bloody Blossoms of the Afterworld’ on the field. | control condition | Not that anyone else would ever use this card since it’s my own custom staple, but this does mean you can’t pull off multiple unless you get the previous one off the field. |
