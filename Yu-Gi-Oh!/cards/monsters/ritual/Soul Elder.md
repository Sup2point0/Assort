## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| You can Ritual Summon this card with ‘Soul Prophecy’. | Summon condition | | There’s nothing stopping it from being Summoned by [Soul Ritual](../../spells/Soul%20Ritual.md) of course, this is just for flavour. |
| Must be Ritual Summoned. | Summon condition | | Yep, no cheating this out. |
| Negate the effects of monsters without a Level. | continuous | | That’s rough. Not on *Soul*, since all Monsters have Levels, but any Xyz or Link strategies... hehe. |
| Once per turn, if a ‘Soul’ card is banished: You can banish 1 card from your opponent’s field or Graveyard. | trigger | | *Soul* banishes cards *all the time*, so this is easily triggered. |
| If a ‘Soul’ card you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish 1 ‘Soul’ card from your Graveyard instead. | continuous | | Stellar protection that’s really hard to deal with (if there are loads of *Soul* cards in the Grave), and also happens to trigger the effect above. |

## Trivia

- This card has the highest original DEF of any *Soul* Monster.
  - It is also has the highest Level of any Main Deck *Soul* Monster.
- This card’s trigger effect is inspired by [Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign – Chengying](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Swordsoul_Supreme_Sovereign_-_Chengying).
  - However, this card banishes from either the field or Grave, not both.
