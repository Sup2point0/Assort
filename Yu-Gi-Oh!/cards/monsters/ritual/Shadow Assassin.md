## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| 2950 ATK | attack | ~ | Ends in 50, just like the *Soul* Monsters. |
| You can Ritual Summon this card with ‘Shadow Surge’. | Summon condition | | Interestingly, Shadow Surge can *only* Ritual Summon this card from the Grave or Banished Pile. |
| If this card is Special Summoned by other ways, send it to the Graveyard during the End Phase. | condition | | Aw yeah, now that’s *full* of flavour. Love it. |
| When your opponent activates a monster effect (Quick Effect): You can banish this card until the end of this turn; banish that monster, and if you do, negate that effect, also inflict damage equal to its original ATK. | quick | | Quite the powerful effect that can even help this card evade removal. As for flavour, think of it as the assassin jumping in (and so abandoning its position in the line of defence) to cut the throat of that Monster, before it can pull off its effect, and so dealing damage to the opponent. |

## Trivia

- This card is a Ritual evolution of [Silent Assassin](../standard/Silent%20Assassin.md).
  - As such, its name is very similar, just with a different adjective.
  - It also inherits Silent Assassin’s effect to respond to the opponent’s Monster effects, but significantly stronger.
- This card synergises extremely well with the [*Soul*](../../../archetypes/Soul.md) archetype.
  - *Soul* revolves around the Grave, so can help get this card into the Grave to be Ritual Summoned. Although it may be more difficult to send it from the hand to the Grave than straight from the Deck, since this card is Lv10 it is perfect to Tribute for Ritual Summoning any of the *Soul* [Ritual Monsters](../../../archetypes/Soul.md#Ritual-Monsters).
  - *Soul* also happens to lack Monster negates ([Soul Wanderer](../../../archetypes/Soul.md#Mid-Level-Synchro-Monsters) can only negate Spell/Traps), which this card very much helps out with.
