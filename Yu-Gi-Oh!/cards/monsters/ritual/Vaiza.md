## Trivia

- This card is the counterpart to [Raiza, Sorceress of Darquess](Raiza.md).
  - They each have 6 identical or very similar effects.
    - Laiza prevents Special Summoning non-DARK monsters from the Extra Deck, while Raiza prevents Normal Summoning non-DARK monsters.
    - Laiza inflicts 350 damage each time a card is banished, while Raiza banishes the top card of the opponent’s Deck face-down each time the player themselves takes damage.
    - Laiza Special Summons a banished DARK monster, while Raiza banishes one.
- This card’s trigger-like and ignition effects synchronyze very well with Raiza.
  - Since the [Darquess](../../archetypes/Darquess.md) archetype has plenty of effects that deal damage to the player themselves, each time they do Raiza banishes a card from the opponent’s Deck, which then triggers Laiza’s effect to deal damage.
  - Using Raiza’s ignition effect, an opponent’s DARK monster can be banished, and then easily stolen using Laiza’s ignition effect.
- The artwork is of Coven Morgana from League of Legends.
