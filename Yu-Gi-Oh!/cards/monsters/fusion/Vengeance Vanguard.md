## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| ? ATK | attack | ~ | |
| Must be Special Summoned (from your Extra Deck) by ‘Victory in Vengeance’, or by banishing the above cards, and 4 or more ‘Soul’ Ritual and/or Synchro Monsters with different names, from your field and/or Graveyard while your LP are lower than your opponent. | Summon condition | | Probably the longest Summoning condition I’ve ever written. Also, it was easier to specify the other 4 ‘Soul’ Monsters in the condition rather than the line above, just so that the Materials don’t run over onto 2 lines, which looks *really* messy. |
| Cannot be targeted or banished by card effects. | continuous | | Slightly more niche than targeting and destruction protection, but is perfect against decks that focus too much on banishing. |
| Gains 700 ATK for each of your banished monsters. | continuous | | Since it banishes at least 7 Monsters to Summon itself (and [Victory in Vengeance](../../traps/Victory%20in%20Vengeance.md) can only Summon this card if it manages to banish 7 or more Monsters), it’s gonna have at least 4900 ATK. And in *Soul*? Yeah, that’s gonna climb up to ridiculous heights. |
| If this card is Summoned: Pay half your LP; banish all cards from your opponent’s field and Graveyard. | mandatory trigger | Eternal Vengeance | Yeup. That’s literally what the card is for. |
| Cards and effects cannot be activated in response to this effect’s activation. | lock condition | | And of course, we can’t let our opponent prevent the fury of our vengeance. |

## Trivia

- This Monster is the final boss of the [*Soul*](../../../archetypes/Soul.md) archetype, despite not being part of the archetype itself.
- It is (very loosely) an upgrade of [Soul Slayer](../sychro/Soul%20Slayer.md).
- This card’s trigger effect is slightly similar to[Victory in Vengeance](../../traps/Victory%20in%20Vengeance.md).
- This Monster was originally a (Link-4) Link Monster.
  - It had 3 Link Arrows pointing in the upwards directions and 1 pointing straight down.
  - This was very early during my return to Yu-Gi-Oh, so I was fascinated by Link Monsters and thought it would be cool to make the ultimate boss one of them. In practice, it’s far more fitting as a Fusion Monster.
- This was the first entirely overpowered, utterly over-the-top, totally over-tuned boss Monster I created.
  - My first custom deck, *Vengeance*, was named after it.
