| Activate 1 of the following effects. | selection | Functions both as a Ritual and Fusion Spell. |
| ● Ritual Summon 1 ‘Darquess’ Ritual monster from your hand or Graveyard. You must also Tribute DARK monsters from your hand or field, and/or banish DARK monsters from either player’s Graveyard, whose total Levels and ATK equal or exceed those of the Ritual monster. | activation | Fairly complex. Importantly, the ‘Tributes’ have to fulfil both a Level and ATK requirement. |
| ● Fusion Summon 1 ‘Darquess’ Fusion monster from your Extra Deck or Graveyard, by banishing materials from your field or Graveyard. | activation | Importantly, it cannot banish from the hand, so requires Materials to be brought out first or buried in the Grave by other means. |
| If you take damage: You can add this banished card to your hand, then you can return 1 of your banished ‘Darquess’ monsters to the Graveyard. | ignition-like, hard once per turn | Self-recovery, just like [Meteonis Drytron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Meteonis_Drytron). |
