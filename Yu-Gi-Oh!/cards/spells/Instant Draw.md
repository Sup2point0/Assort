| Activate 1 of the following effects. | selection | |
| • Tribute 2 other cards from your hand and/or field; draw 2 cards. | activation | It is indeed a loss in card advantage, but since it’s Quick-Play Spell, just like [Forbidden Droplet]() you can Chain it to another Spell to reduce the lost advantage. |
| • Discard 1 ‘Instant Draw’; draw 2 cards. | activation | And, if you happen to have another copy, then wahey, free unbrick! |
| • If your opponent controls more cards than you, and you have less than 2 cards in your hand: Pay half your LP; draw 2 cards. | activation | Or if it’s an anime duel moment, then this’ll be the card to save you. |
| You can only activate ‘Instant Draw’ once per turn. | turnly restriction | But you’re only pulling off 1 of these effects in a turn. |

## Trivia

- This card’s original effect was `Discard 1 card; draw 2 cards.`.
  - However, this was far too generic, and would render cards like [Allure of Darkness](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Allure_of_Darkness) or [Trade-In](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Trade-In) rather meaningless.
- This card’s art is taken from [Shining Draw](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shining_Draw_(card)).
