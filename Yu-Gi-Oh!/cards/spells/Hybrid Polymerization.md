| You can use a card(s) you control as material for both Summons. | resolution | To clarify, the idea is to fuse 1 Monster you control with others twice – like [Fallen of Albaz](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fallen_of_Albaz) using its effect twice. |
| You cannot Summon monsters from the Extra Deck the turn activate this card, except by the effect of ‘Hybrid Polymerization’. | lock condition | However, it does come with a pretty harsh turn-wide restriction, so this is actually best left as an interruption for your opponent’s turn. |
| You can only use ‘Hybrid Polymerization’ once per turn. | turnly restriction |
