## Aspects

| aspect | type | name | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| Target 1 other card on the field; Move it to an appropriate adjacent Zone, then add 1 ‘Rubic’ card from your Deck to your hand. | activation | | Such a simple effect, yet so ridiculously powerful. |
| If a card moves to another Zone, while this card is in your Graveyard: You can target 1 of your banished ‘Rubic’ cards; Return it to the Graveyard, and if you do, add this card to your hand. | trigger | | non-HOPT, btw |
| You cannot activate Monster effects, except those of ‘Rubic’ Monsters, the turn you activate this card’s effects. | lock condition | | xenophobicity, let’s go |
| You can only activate ‘Rubic Algorithm’ once per turn. | turnly restriction | | But you can’t abuse the card (that) much like Engage. |

## Trivia

- This card is named after [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) in [speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube).
- This card is similar to [Sky Striker Mobilize – Engage!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Sky_Striker_Mobilize_-_Engage!) and [Meteonis Drytron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Meteonis_Drytron).
  - Like Engage, it searches an archetypal card, while providing addicional advantage.
  - Like Meteonis Drytron, it has self-recursion.
