## Aspects

| aspect | type | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :---- |
| Draw cards until you draw a Spell/Trap (max 3), then you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower monster from your hand, also after that, for each card you drew, shuffle 1 card from your hand into the Deck. | activation | Even if it is technically a loss in card advantage, it’s still a pretty powerful effect that lets you dig for cards. |
| For the rest of the turn after this card resolves, each time you add a card from your Deck to your hand by card effect, you must immediately discard 1 card. | lingering | Oh yeah, that’s gonna hurt. |

## Trivia

- This card’s art is taken from [Drastic Draw](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drastic_Draw).
- This is one of the earliest custom cards I created (as in, even before I discovered DuelingBook).
