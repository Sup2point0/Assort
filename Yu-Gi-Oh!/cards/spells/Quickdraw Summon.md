| Draw cards until you draw a Spell/Trap (max 3), then you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower monster from your hand, also after that, for each card you drew, shuffle 1 card from your hand into the Deck. For the rest of the turn after this card resolves, each time you add a card from your Deck to your hand by card effect, you must immediately discard 1 card. |
