## Aspects

| aspect | type | notes |
| :----- | :--- | :---- |
| Fusion Summon 1 Fusion monster from your Extra Deck, using monsters from your hand or field as material. | activation | Polymerization on steroids, fusing at Spell Speed 2. |
| If your opponent controls a monster Summoned from the Extra Deck, you can also use 1 monster from your Deck as material, but send the Summoned monster to the Graveyard during the End Phase. | resolution | A fairly dangerous effect balanced only by exactly which monsters it can send. Since I only use this in custom decks, I always make sure it won’t end up being broken, but yeah – there’s no way this would be added to the actual game. |
| You can only activate ‘Quick Polymerization’ once per turn. | turnly restriction | And ofc, this definitely needs a once per turn restriction. |

## Trivia

- This is one of the earliest custom cards I created (as in, even before I discovered DuelingBook).
