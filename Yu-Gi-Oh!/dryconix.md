# Dryconix
 
My absolute favourite deck of all time. Despite having 9 Ritual Monsters, single copies of staples, and ~~nearing~~ 60 cards, it’s still surprisingly consistent, insanely versatile, and can definitely hold its own.

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Drytron Alpha Thuban](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Alpha_Thuban) | x3 | |
| [Drytron Zeta Aldibah](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Zeta_Aldibah) | x3 | I really wish it could recover Ritual Spells from the Grave, since it becomes rather useless late game. |
| [Drytron Delta Altais](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Delta_Altais) | x2 | My favourite Drytron, the draw is always insane. |
| [Drytron Gamma Eltanin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Gamma_Eltanin) | x2 | Pivotal for comebacks, but I don’t need the extension normally. |
| [Drytron Beta Rastaban](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Beta_Rastaban) | x1 | Saviour against Runick or Dimension Shifter, seriously clutch. |
| [Ultimate Knight Alpha Ursatron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Knight_Alpha_Ursatron) | x2 | Not *perfect* support by any means (since it’s unsearchable and can’t be used as Material for Mu Beta Fafnir or Herald of Mirage Lights) but being able to search Fafnir for negate protection is wonderful. |
| [Drytron Meteonis Draconids](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Meteonis_Draconids) | x1 | Very strong against certain archetypes, and epic for OTKs. |
| [Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Meteonis_Quadrantids) | x1 | Ruins backrow. |
| [Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | My favourite Ritual Monster after White Zoa. Being able to actually play it is so wonderful. |
| [Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Great to leave on an endboard, and clearing threatening backrow before my opponent realyzes what’s going on. |
| [Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Often underestimated, but super versatile against decks that just can’t handle both targeting and destruction immunity *and* high ATK – Labrynth, Runick, even Tearlaments and Kashtira. |
| [Shinobaron Peacock](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Insane removal, especially against Avramax, Mirrorjade or HEROs. |
| [White Relic of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Relic_of_Dogmatika) | x1 | Surprisingly good for OTKs, and an easy out to an Accesscode Talker if didn’t manage to strike for game. |
| [White Knight of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Knight_of_Dogmatika) | x1 | Great when we’ve got nothing else. |
| [White Zoa of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dogmatika_Alba_Zoa) | x1 | Technically Alba Zoa now, but whatever, White Zoa is the better name. Anyway, the ace of the deck! |
| [Diviner of the Herald](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Diviner_of_the_Herald) | x3 | Does scare people into thinking this is Herald Drytron, but nooo, we’re going into Lv7 Synchro toolbox B) |

  <summary> <b> Extra Deck </b> </summary> <br>

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Drytron Mu Beta Fafnir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Mu_Beta_Fafnir) | x2 | Insane consistency tool. As long as we can get 2 Drytrons on the field, this’ll guarantee any missing pieces we need. If we don’t end with Amorphactor Pain, it even provides a negate to protect against boardbreakers. Unfortunately, for Extra Deck space I’ve had to cut this down to 2 copies, but rarely does that come back to bite. |
| [Herald of the Arc Light](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Herald_of_the_Arc_Light) | x3 | Of course, the perfect Monster to bury from our Extra Deck. And with Drytron, the more Rituals in hand, the better. We can even Synchro Summon it with Ash Blossom (Lv3 Tuner) and a Drytron (Lv1), which is better than keeping Ash in hand, since this can negate any card or effect – with a search right after too! Aside from working under Amorphactor Pain (since it Tributes itself as cost, so its effect won’t be negated), it even blocks Droplet by preventing anyone from sending cards to the Grave as cost. Just insane value. |
| [Elder Entity N'tss](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | One’s enough, just for the situations where we really need it. |
| [Clear Wing Synchro Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Clear_Wing_Synchro_Dragon) | x1 | This is my favourite Synchro Monster, so naturally I was delighted when I realyzed I could throw it in Drytron. A stellar option if we don’t have enough to bring out a double-Tribute Ritual Monster. |
| [Black Rose Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Black_Rose_Dragon) | x1 | A nice backup to have when we really just need to *nuke the board*. |
| [Wind Pegasus @Ignister](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Works under Amorphactor Pain and in the Grave, even has Spell/Trap removal for followup. |
| [Linkuriboh](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Linkuriboh) | x1 | Pivotal for optilical combo sequencing. Clutch when you need it. |
| [Relinquished Anima](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Hilarious when it works, perfect for plucking back a Lava Golem too. |
| [Herald of Mirage Lights](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Herald_of_Mirage_Lights) | x1 | This, *this*, is the missing piece I spent so long looking for – too often do I end with extra bodies (especially if I’ve used Gamma) which don’t do anything, and I can’t clean up for anything else (IP Masquerena would take even more Extra Deck space for other staples, which I refuse to resort to) – but what would really help is a recovery option. That’s exactly what Herald of Mirage Lights does, grabbing back not 1, but *2* Ritual cards – how awesome is that! No longer do I need to rest on the Heart of the Cards every time my opponent dismantles my board and I have no more Rituals left in hand. |
| [Lyrilusc – Assembled Nightingale](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | If the opponent has an unbreakable board but no interruptions, then it’s time for an emergency OTK with Assembled Nightingale and White Relic. |
| [Raidraptor – Ultimate Falcon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | I actually love this card, considering my first deck was Raidraptor. *So* many decks just cannot handle this being dropped on them. |
| [Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Infinitrack_Fortress_Megaclops) | x1 | Waking the Dragon moment lmao |

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Meteonis Drytron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Meteonis_Drytron) | x2 | Always nice to have 2, just in case one gets banished, or to allow more than 1 Ritual Summon in later turns. |
| [Drytron Fafnir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Fafnir) | x3 | Eh, the search is cool and all, but I’m here for *negate protection* – that feeling when your opponent Solemns Meteonis Drytron and is left confuzzled as to why it didn’t work – also, the level manipulyzacion effect that no one pays any attention too can *really* disrupt any Synchro or Xyz decks. |
| [Cyber Emergency](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Emergency) | x3 | Quality searcher, can grab a Draconids or Quadrantids to Tribute for White Zoa too if needed. |
| [Drytron Nova](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Nova) | x3 | This deck needs all the consistency it can get. |
| [Drytron Eclipse](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Eclipse) | x1 | Surprisingly clutch, super useful for recovering a Drytron mech to sacrifice for White Zoa, and the ATK boost is splendid with Draconids for OTKs. |
| [Nadir Servant](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Nadir_Servant) | x1 | Insane value, searching an extra Ritual Monster to Tribute and any Ritual card (by sending Arc Light). Had several games where topdecking this instantly turned the fight around. |
| [Dogmatikatrix](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x2 | Just incredible searching power, especially if going second, and leaves Drytrons free to search for other Ritual cards. Once we’ve got White Zoa out, we can even scout out our opponent’s Extra Deck or bury any Monster from our own for even more value. |
| [Dogmatikabre](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Just for White Zoa, but also useful with the lower Level Dogmatika Rituals if I have Herald of the Arc Lights in the Grave. |
| [Where Arf Thou?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x2 | Another searcher for consistency, can search Droll & Lock Bird if I’ve got all the Drytron modules I need. |
| [Preparation of Rites](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Searches Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon for opening setup, or White Relic of Dogmatika for OTK, and a free recovery (especially for Dogmatikabre to revive Zoa). |
| [Pre-Preparation of Rites](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Searches Dogmatikabre and a free Dogmatika Ritual Monster to Tribute, and acts as an Ash bait, even if it is a dead draw later on. |

### Traps

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Drytron Meteor Shower](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | It’s hilarious how few people actually know Drytron even has a Counter Trap, but it’s not bad at all, despite having no Grave effects like those of so many other archetypes. Hitting a Summon can often be just as devastyzing as negating an effect, undoing all the work put into bringing out a duel closer. |

</details>

### Staples

<details open>
  <summary> <b> display </b> </summary> <br>

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Lava Golem](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Such a powerful boardbreaker. Fits perfectly with Drytron since it can’t be Normal Summoned, and Drytron doesn’t really need a Normal Summon anyway. |
| [Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x2 | I didn’t use to run this since stopping people from playing the game isn’t fun, but... man am I tired of Maxx C... and Branded Fusion into Mirrorjade... and Chixiao into Chengying... and Block Dragon – you get the idea. Also, most of the time I Normal Summon it to tune with a Drytron to make a spare Herald of the Arc Light! Insane value. |
| [Droll & Lock Bird](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Can’t use it against Maxx C since it literally locks myself, but searchable with *Where Arf Thou?* and shuts some decks down nicely. Quite a mean handtrap tho. |
| [Forbidden Droplet](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Another reason to leave spare Drytron modules on board. Splendid in Drytron, especially when going second, since the modules don’t really care if they’re in the Hand or Grave. |
| [Triple Tactics Talent](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Quality response and all too easy to trigger. |
| [Ultimate Slayer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | People should give this more recognition honestly. Perfect against Synchro decks to send a Herald of the Arc Light for an extra search, or against Fusion decks to send a N'tss for a free pop. Nicely avoids Mirrorjade and Chengying’s effects. |
| [Infinite Impermanence](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Why only 1, I know. I don’t really play it as interruption (unless it’s Aluber or Chixiao), but rather an opener when going second to neutralyze a threat or draw out a negate. |
| [Evenly Matched](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Actually cracked. |
| [Waking the Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Not a staple, I know. Yet the amount of times this has worked and saved me by bringing out Ultimate Falcon or Infinitrack Megaclops is *staggering*. |

## Strategics

### End Board
The dream endboard consists of White Zoa, Amorphactor Pain, Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon, Elder Entity.

White Zoa needs 3 cards to Ritual Summon – itself, Dogmatikabre, and a Draconids or Quadrantids in Hand to Tribute (or we could have a Lv8 Ritual and banish an Arc Light from the Grave, that works too). Regardless, it’s quite a lot to ask, and while it has stellar protection and a devastyzing effect, it’s probably not enough to hold up on its own – which means we can’t just abandon the Drytron side of things. So, I’ll only bring it out if I can still Ritual Summon other Ritual Monsters with Meteonis Drytron.

Luckily, Drytron’s got... wouldn’t say plenty, but definitely enough cards to search out all the Ritual Spells and Monsters we need. Nadir Servant is great for searching any missing piece we need, and if we go second Dogmatikatrix can grab both White Zoa and Dogmatikabre all in one go, or even another copy of itself if we’ve already got one of those.

</details>

### Adamancipator

### Blue-Eyes
Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon is such a pain. Luckily, Draconids can’t be targeted by it, and has excellent removal in case the opponent has a higher ATK Monster. Ironically, the best weapon against them is their own ace Monster – Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon.

### Branded Despia
This is actually so fun to play against, even if I do end up losing most of the time. Since its speciality is removal and doesn’t have negates at all, it presents a far more interesting challenge to overcome – many of my most exhilaryzing and memorable duels have been against Branded Despia. I love playing against duelists who really *know* the deck and don’t just play it cuz meta. Especially those who take it further and stretch its capabilitys, like Fusion Summoning twice in one Chain Link with Lubellion and Branded in Red.

Amorphactor Pain is my greatest weapon against them, but even then they can easily battle over it, and if I want to dismantle their board, Mirrorjade presents a difficult challenge to remove.

### Bystial
Well, I’ma head out.

Yeah no, Bystial totally kills Drytron.

### Dark Magician
Its only real interruption is the banish from Dark Magical Circle, which could be critical if we’ve got a weak hand, but is usually easy to overcome. Quadrantids is lethal against Dark Magician, since they can’t recover their Spell/Traps, and if they’ve activyzen Eternal Soul then they just end up nuking their own field.

### Dinomorphia

### Dogmatika
Haha, I’m afraid you just milled my 3 ARC LIGHTS – yeah, the mirror match is hilarious if they blindly mill my Extra Deck.

### Eldlich
Again, Chaos MAX Dragon. Can be a challenge to play against sometimes if they manage to snipe Meteonis Drytron in the Grave with Huaquero.

### Floowandereeze
What a pain to play against.

### Kashtira
Aside from it being a horribly generic, efficient, vicious deck, Kashtira actually can’t handle targeting protection, and it can’t go over 3000 ATK, making Chaos MAX Dragon a fantastic weapon against them... if I can actually bring it out in the first place, what with all my Zones locked.

### Labrynth
Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon insta-win. Labrynth can’t handle targeting and destruction protection or that 4000 ATK, unless they bring out Skill Drain. Then we’re screwed.

Alternatively, they trigger Waking the Dragon and we drop Ultimate Falcon on them, which is a definitive insta-win.

### Marincess
This shouldn’t be that hard to beat, but it is. Y’know what, returning to the original Ritual Monsters works wonderfully – Draconids and Quadrantids keep pressure on them by clearing their Spell/Traps each turn, and Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon really hurts since they combo so much.

### Mathmech
I also play Mathmech myself, so I’m really familiar with how it works. And it can be really dangerous if we’re uncareful. Luckily skipping their Main Phase 1 with Amorphactor Pain neutralyzes the threat of an OTK, and if they don’t read and overlay into Alembertian or Laplacian while it’s on the field then things will be much more difficult for them.

If they go first and drop Superfactorial early, then counterplay is really quite difficult with the resource rip and negate. Draconids is probably the most effective here, to remove materials before they can Synchro into Final Sigma or Link into Accesscode.

### Pendulum Magician
Never did I think I would hate such a cool deck (since I absolutely loved Yuya’s deck in Arc-V), but the endboards it cryzes are really, really toxic, and literally none of the cards are actually archetypical. Apollousa is enough to kill Drytron, but a Baronne de Fleur, Hope Harbinger, Borreload Savage Dragon, *and* Time Pendulumgraph too? Even if I draw Forbidden Droplet, it’ll cripple my Hand, and I don’t run Dark Ruler No More anymore.

### Runick
Honestly makes me want to crawl up and die. Whenever I face this, the race is on to grab Chaos MAX Dragon before they banish it, since just like with Labrynth, it’s an insta-win. It feels *soo* good crashing into a Hugin to deal perfectly 8000 damage. Unless they have Skill Drain... and they probably do. In which case, Quadrantids is our only good option, since whenever they destroy it it’ll bring back more Drytrons, hopefully to attack directly. Unless they have There Can Be Only One. Oh my days. What an absolute pain. And Dimensional Fissure. ALL the floodgates.

### Sky Striker
It’s beyond me how this deck even manages to put up a fight – maybe they just always catch me on a subpar hand.

### Spright
Well, this is really tough to beat. Since everything in Drytron is an activyzen effect, negates really hurt, and Spright is full of them. Amorphactor Pain can’t keep them at bay, and Chaos MAX Dragon falls to Spright Double Cross or a boosted Gigantic Spright.

If I want to win, I have to play as viciously as I can, which means not letting Spright play at all. Currently the best strategic I’ve found is to clear their field, which means they can’t use their innate Special Summons. Hitting their Normal Summon with Meteor Shower or Draconids kills them entirely, unless they have Starter. If they start with Starter we’re basically screwed, unless they Summon Gigantic with nothing else on the field, in which case hitting that with Draconids clears their field.

If it’s Runick Spright, then there’s very little hope, what with the insane advantage Fountain generyzes and the free Lv2 Special Summons that we just can’t stop.

### Swordsoul
Swordsoul and Swordsoul Tenyi, unlike Branded Despia, are such a pain to play against. Which is weird, since both decks feature single-card opening combos and tech in other Monsters of their Summoning tecnique – and I even find Synchro Monsters cooler than Fusion Monsters. I suppose it’s because Swordsoul is so braindead to play, and provides such easy access to high-Level Synchro Monsters that would otherwise be much more difficult to Summon.

### Tearlaments
Well, after dropping in Master Duel, almost every other duel I have is against Tearlaments. That’s *Ishizu* Tearlaments, I should specify.

## Questions

### Why no Cyber Angel Benten?
Yeah, I’d love to reliably have Diviner for Lv7 Synchro Monsters, but I just don’t feel good playing Benten – I don’t really want to spend a Ritual search on it, using it feels like degeneracy, and above all I just don’t like its art... at all.

### Why Dogmatikabre instead of Dogmatikalamity?
Sure, Dogmatikalamity lets you Tribute straight from the Extra Deck, but it has 3 major downsides – it can’t Ritual Summon from the Grave, it can’t be searched by Pre-Preparation of Rites, and it locks you out of the Extra Deck.

Being able to revive from the Grave is huge, since it means we don’t need to keep the Dogmatika Ritual Monsters in Hand, and can Tribute them for Drytrons. Even if White Zoa being ripped from our Hand or Deck, we can still bring it back; we can even search it ourselves with Foolish Burial, if needed. It’s just far more flexible and versatile in general, particularly in late game, where Dogmatikalamity would otherwise be dead draw.

Locking us out of the Extra Deck doesn’t matter too much, since we could just drop White Zoa at the end of our combo anyway; but if we have Dogmatikatrix, bringing out a Dogmatika Ritual Monster as soon as possible means we’d be able to see what our opponent is playing, and setup an endboard accordingly, or if we’re lacking cards we need, send an Arc Light from our Extra Deck for a clutch search.

And of course, being searchable by Pre-Preparation of Rites is nice, freeing up our Zeta to search for Meteonis Drytron.
