# Dryconix

My absolute favourite deck of all time. Despite having 9 Ritual monsters, single copies of unconventional handtraps, and nearing *60* cards, it’s still surprisingly consistent, insanely versatile, and can definitely hold its own.

| [Drytron Delta Altais](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Delta_Altais) | x2 | My favourite Drytron, the draw is always insane. |
| [Drytron Gamma Eltanin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Gamma_Eltanin) | x2 | |
| [Drytron Beta Rastaban](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Beta_Rastaban) | x1 | Saviour against Runick or Dimension Shifter, seriously clutch. |

| [Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | |
| [Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Super versatile against decks that just can’t handle both targeting and destruction immunity *and* high ATK – Labrynth, Runick, even Eldlitch. |
| [Shinobaron Peacock](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Insane removal. |
| [White Relic of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Relic_of_Dogmatika) | x1 | |
| [White Knight of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Knight_of_Dogmatika) | x1 | |
| [White Zoa of Dogmatika](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dogmatika_Alba_Zoa) | x1 | Technically Alba Zoa now, but whatever, White Zoa is the better name. Anyway, the ace of the deck! |
| [Diviner of the Herald](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Diviner_of_the_Herald) | x3 | Does scare people into thinking this is Herald Drytron, but nooo, we’re going into Lv7 Synchro toolbox B) |

| [Linkuriboh](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Pivotal for optilical combo sequencing. |
| [Relinquished Anima](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Hilarious when it works, perfect for plucking back a Lava Golem too. |
| [Lyrilusc – Assembled Nightingale](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Emergency OTK! |
| [Raidraptor – Ultimate Falcon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | I actually love this card, considering my first deck was Raidraptor. |

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Meteonis Drytron](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Meteonis_Drytron) | x2 | Always nice to have 2, just in case one gets banished, or to allow more than 1 Ritual Summon in later turns. |
| [Drytron Fafnir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Fafnir) | x3 | Eh, the search is cool and all, but I’m here for *negate protection* – that feeling when your opponent Solemns Meteonis Drytron and is left confuzzled as to why it didn’t work – also, the level manipulation effect that no one pays any attention too can *really* disrupt Swordsoul (Chixiao) or Adamancipator (Gallant Granite) |
| [Cyber Emergency](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Emergency) | x3 | Quality searcher, can grab a Draconids or Quadrantids to Tribute for White Zoa too if needed. |
| [Drytron Nova](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Nova) | x3 | |
| [Drytron Eclipse](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Drytron_Eclipse) | x1 | Surprisingly clutch, super useful for recovering a Drytron Ritual to sacrifice for Zoa, and the ATK boost is splendid with Draconids for OTK. |
| [Nadir Servant](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Nadir_Servant) | x1 | |
| [Dogmatikatrix](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x2 | Just incredible searching power, leaves modules free to search for the regular Rituals. |
| [Dogmatikamacabre](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Just for White Zoa, but also useful with the lower Level Dogmatika Rituals if I have Herald of the Arc Lights in the Graveyard. |
| [Where Arf Thou?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x2 | Another searcher for consistency, can search Droll & Lock Bird if I’ve got all the Drytron modules I need. |
| [Preparation of Rites](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Searches Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon for opening setup, or White Relic of Dogmatika for OTK, and a free recovery (especially for Dogmatikamacabre to revive Zoa). |
| [Pre-Preparation of Rites](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Searches Dogmatikamacabre and a free Dogmatika Ritual monster to Tribute, even if it is a dead draw later on. |

### Staples

  <summary> <b> display </b> </summary> <br>

| card | copies | notes |
| :--- | :----- | :---- |
| [Lava Golem](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Such a powerful boardbreaker, and fits perfectly with Drytron since it can’t be Normal Summoned, and Drytron doesn’t really need a Normal Summon anyway. |
| [Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x2 | I didn’t use to run this since stopping people from playing the game isn’t fun, but... man am I tired of Maxx C... and Branded Fusion into Mirrorjade... and Chixiao into Chengying... and Block Dragon – you get the idea. Also, most of the time I Normal Summon it to tune with a Drytron to make a spare Herald of the Arc Light! Insane value. |
| [Droll & Lock Bird](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Can’t use it against Maxx C since it literally locks myself, but searchable with *Where Arf Thou?* and shuts some decks down nicely. Quite a mean handtrap tho. |
| [Dark Ruler No More](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | |
| [Forbidden Droplet](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Finally, a reason to leave extra Drytron modules on board! Splendid in Drytron, especially when going second, since the modules don’t really care if they’re in the hand or Graveyard. |
| [Triple Tactics Talent](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Quality response and all too easy to trigger. |
| [Ultimate Slayer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | People should give this more recognition honestly. Perfect against Synchro decks to send a Herald of the Arc Light for an extra search, or against Fusion decks to send a N'tss for a free pop. Nicely avoids Mirrorjade and Chengying’s effects. |
| [Infinite Impermanence](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Why only 1, I know. I don’t really play it as interruption (unless it’s Aluber or Chixiao), but rather an opener when going second to neutralyze a threat or draw out a negate. |
| [Evenly Matched](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Actually cracked. |
| [Waking the Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/) | x1 | Not a staple, I know. Yet the amount of times this has worked and saved me by bringing out Ultimate Falcon or Infinitrack Megaclops is staggering. |

## Strategics

There are kinda 2 versions of this deck – the *Master Duel* one without White Zoa or Dogmatikatrix, but Maxx C, and the ‘modern’ one with the protic and without the deutic.

### Master Duel
Standard endboard consists of Amorphactor Pain and Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon, as well as Wind Pegasus @Ignister if I’ve used Diviner of the Herald.

If things go catastrophically wrong, we end on Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and/or a Dogmatika Ritual.

Waking the Dragon is insanely effective, since *so* many people have Spell/Trap removal and use it for no particular reason.

### Modern
Target endboard is the same as Master Duel, just with White Zoa too, though this is difficult to achieve without the right resources.

White Zoa needs 3 cards to Ritual Summon – itself, Dogmatikamacabre, and a Draconids or Quadrantids in hand to Tribute... or we could have a Lv8 Ritual and banish a Herald of the Arc Light from the Graveyard, that works too. Regardless, it’s quite a lot to ask, and while it has stellar protection and a devastating effect, it’s probably not enough to hold up on its own – which means we can’t just abandon the Drytron side of things. So, I’ll only bring it out if I can still Ritual Summon other Ritual monsters with Meteonis Drytron.

Luckily, Drytron’s got... wouldn’t say plenty, but definitely enough cards to search out all the Ritual Spells and monsters we need. Nadir Servant is great for searching any missing piece we need, and if we go second Dogmatikatrix can grab both White Zoa and Dogmatikamacabre all in one go, or even another copy of itself if we’ve already got one of those.
