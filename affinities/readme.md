## Channels

The various ways in which affinities can be harnessed.

To illustrate the differences, consider a [novus](affinities/novis.md). Usually, they will be a haptic novus – *haptonovis* – which means they can turn objects invisible by touching them. A rarer optic novus – *optonovis* – can achieve this simply by looking at objects. An even rarer psychic novus – *psychonovis* – can do this just by thinking about it, meaning they can affect objects they cannot see, sense or know exist. This is generally the hierarchy of power between the 3 channels, with psychic being the most potent – not that this means haptic affinities are weak. Notice the signficant difference is range: while haptic affinitics must come into contact, psychic affinitics can attack from afar, which is more effective.

### Psychic
Affinities controlled by the mind.

### Haptic
Affinities that channel through physical contact. This usually refers to directly touching the skin, but the exact constraints are often variable – {*damn this is hard to phrase*}

### Optic
Affinities controlled by sight.

### Innate
Affinities that stem from within one’s very core. Notice that this is different to psychic – channelling innate affinities feels like part of oneself, as natural as moving a limb.

In moments of extreme emotion or desperation, affinitics may unwittingly channel through their core, which releases affine far more powerful than normal.

Examples include [invisibility](affinities/invisibility.md).
