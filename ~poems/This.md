# This

This longstanding settlement, this harbour of peace;  
This mystical crystal valley, this arcane world;  
This enchanted needle in a haystack, this tiny star in the deep dark;  
This hidden oasis, concealed and entwined with nature,  
Teeming with life and magic, a safe haven for all magical misfits;  
This sanctuary of creatures unknown,  
Wondrous and extraordinary, radiant with the light of magic;  
This collection of abodes, humble and happy;  
This mellow glow among the foliage,  
Like a golden blush along the face of the Earth;  
This refuge, this hearth, this home, this magical village.
