Yes, I spent my time on this.

### Soon, everything would change.
They could feel it, slithering through the undergrowth, dangling from the quivering branches, glinting in the pale moonlight. It was as if an invisible mist was descending upon them. An eerie uncertainty lay hanging in the air. It was too silent.

### “Yap” – it’s an art.
Indeed, concisely articulating one’s thoughts and perspectives is a challenge that requires skill, practice and time; what often goes underappreciated is the converse, the unapologetic predisposition to ‘yap’. It is simple and trivial to produce large, impressive words (or phrases) such as ‘isomorphic conjugacy’ or ‘asynchronous resolution’. More difficult, and very much more humorous, is stringing said words together in a seemingly coherent sentence of extraordinary density.

### A profound sentence here indeed.
The effectiveness of filler text is dependent on a number of factors, some more important than others. This includes the letters (as well as numbers and punctuation) that appear within, the variety and lengths of the words, and the overall structure and semantics of the text. Above all, the aim is to present an accurate portrayal of the typeface’s usage in its intended environment – hence artificially maximising the different circumstances covered by one paragraph is vital.

Coruscating arcs of light streaked across the endless expanse, only to flash out of existence in an instant.

### Increased attack speed brings even greater power.
A common misconception is that between attack speed and attack delay, which are in fact direct inverses of each other. Attack delay refers to the time delay between each attack, often excluding animations, and so the lower, the stronger (ignoring context and game-specific nuances). For example, consider 2 weapons with different cooldowns: 1 shall have a delay of 0.3s between each attack, while the other 0.6s. Evidently the weapon with 0.3s fires faster, and intuitively it follows that it fires twice as fast as the other. This leads nicely on to attack speed, which is generally the preferred metric. This describes the number of attacks over a given duration, often a second, and so is usually described in attacks per second. Note diving 1 by attack delay yields the attack speed – in other words, taking the reciprocal – as it essentially corresponds to the question of “how many times can I fit this cooldown delay into 1 second?” In this way, an interesting relationship between attack speed and delay is revealed: they are directly inversely proportional to each other, where k in xy = k is precisely 1 (given that their time units are equivalent). A slightly more confusing but nonetheless critical aspect to wrap our heads around, is that of increasing and decreasing attack rate. A linear increase in attack speed corresponds to an exponential decrease in attack delay, and vice versa. For this, consider decreasing attack delay from 1s to 0.9s, compared to decreasing from 0.2s to 0.1s. The latter, relatively, is a 50% drop, while the former is only 10%. Similarly, increasing from 1 attack per second to 2 is a significant 100% increase, while 10 to 11 is a mere 10%. Plotting these relationships onto a graph, with the x axis being increasing attack speed, we see that attack delay forms a reciprocal curve. Swapping the x axis for decreasing attack delay, attack speed will form an exponential curve. Hence, when considering the value of a particular upgrade, it is always essential to remember the relative increase in strength, as opposed to the absolute change.
