# The Ideal Day

What my ideal day would look like.

| time | duration | activity | notes |
| :--- | :------- | :------- | :---- |
| 07:30 ~ 08:00 | ~10 | awakening | it’d be nice to just get up whenever I feel like it. |
| – | ~10 | breakfast | sugar puffs cereal, toast, spring onion pancakes |
| – | 20~40 | morning walk | just a lovely stroll to start the day, and adjust my eyes |
| 12:00 ~ 13:00 | 40~60 | lunch | probably noodles, or something else if I feel creative |
| 18:00 ~ 19:00 | 40~60 | dinner | rice and whatever dishes I feel like cooking |
| 23:00 ~ 23:30 | 15 | bedtime | probably lie in bed and stare at my phone for a while, as you do |

Depending on how quickly I fall asleep, this perfectly ensures precisely 5 sleep cycles – 7 and a half hours – leading to a natural awakening between 7:30 and 8:00.
