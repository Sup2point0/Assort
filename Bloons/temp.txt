== <span style="font-family: 'Luckiest Guy';"> About Me </span> ==
I'd say I'm introverted, pretty good-tempered, and more patient than most people are. If you want to know more about me (in general), you could check out my userpages on the [https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/User:Sup2point0 PvZ Wiki], [https://asphalt.fandom.com/wiki/User:Sup2point0 Asphalt Wiki], or [https://soul-knight.fandom.com/wiki/User:Sup2point0 Soul Knight Wiki], as those used to be the Wikis I was most active on.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Bloons Games I've Played </span> ===
My friend showed me ''Bloons TD 5'' on his iPad many years ago during a school trip, and I instantly fell in love with it. Some of my best memories involve spamming Ray of Dooms in Sandbox, spamming ZOMGs at my friend's ultimate Tier IV defence, and spamming... you get the point. I never downloaded it myself, cuz my parent's didn't really let me play games.

Another Bloons game I used to play (and have also recently started playing again) is ''Bloons Super Monkey 2''. Again, this was a game my friend showed me on his iPad many years ago. I really enjoy playing it, and for a decently old game its graphics are pretty good. I also love SHMUPs, so Bloons + SHMUP? Perfection.

Currently I play ''Bloons TD 6''. I absolutely love this game, and at least imo it's the only game in the world apart from Minecraft that is close to being a 'perfect' game. I play anywhere between 0~2 hours a day, although mostly on weekends and during holidays. I could ramble for hours about how beautifully designed the game is, but I won't do that.

I've also started playing ''Bloons Pop!''. It's quite a fun little game to kill time, and one of my favourite things to do is play it alongside BTD6 - while I'm waiting for enough cash for an upgrade, I can just quickly complete a Bloons Pop! level so that I'm not bored - even though I'm perfectly happy to wait and just watch the monkeys do their stuff. Tbh, Bloons Pop! might actually be even more well-designed than BTD6... but I still haven't fully decided on that yet.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> My Play Style </span> ===
I'm more of a casual player, so I mostly just play Odysseys for trophies to buy nice cosmetics in the trophy store, and slowly work my way through the different maps. I don't really play Races, cuz I'm just not good at them (when I initially started I didn't realize you were supposed to spam rounds, and I only sent like 2 or 3 rounds whenever I felt I was doing well, so I ended up with times of like 30 minutes xD). Also, I love playing around in Sandbox. There's always something new to test. There have been many occasions where I have lost myself in Sandbox for... far longer than I should have.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Preferences and Stuff </span> ===
I have a couple of perhaps slightly strange preferences.
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
: I like using Roman numerals where suitable, cuz I just think it makes things look cooler.
:: The most common example would be ''Tier V'', ''Tier IV'', etc.
:: However, I still say ''Bloons TD '''6'''''.
: I usually say ''Upper Path'', sometimes ''Top Path'', but never ''Path 1''.
: I prefer saying the upgrade name and crosspath, rather than using an upgrade code.
:: For example, ''Crossbow Master with Very Quick Shots'', not ''0-2-5 Dart Monkey''.
:: If I do choose to use the upgrade code, I prefer spelling it x-x-x when there are no ''x''s (e.g. ''5-0-2''), but xxx when there are ''x''s (e.g. ''5xx'')
</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Random Facts </span> ===
Just a couple of random facts about me.
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
: I am kinda OCD, and I always try to organize my monkeys nicely, so:
:: - I hate it when monkeys overlap (i.e. when they merge strangely)
:: - I hate it when bloons overlap irregularly (e.g. when a long line of MOABs comes and suddenly one overlaps to the front)
:: - I hate it when a Spike-o-Pult / Plasma Accelerator doesn't shoot perfectly straight down a straight line (or any other straight-shooting monkey)
:: - I hate it when Heli pads or Ace runways partially cover flowers or other map decorations (If they're gonna cover them, COVER THE WHOLE THING)
:: - I hate it when I place a Tack Shooter off-centre in a loop

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> General </span> ===
: Favourite Game: <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Bloons TD 6</span>
:: <div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">There are so many reasons why I love Bloons TD 6 (more than BTD5), but I'll be quick: I absolutely adore its graphics - the semi-minimalist vector style and 3D graphics; I love that there are 3 different upgrade paths, it makes towers so much more unique and opens up loads of new possibilities; Sandbox is much better than in BTD5... and more.</div>
: Favourite Track: <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Cubism</span>
: Favourite Gamemode: <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Sandbox</span>
: Favourite BTD6 YouTuber: <span style="color:#00c832;">ISAB</span>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Monkeys </span> ===
It's too hard to decide on one, so these are my favourite 6:
: - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Tack Shooter</span>
: - <span style="color:#00c832;">Monkey Sub</span>
: - <span style="color:#00c832;">Monkey Buccaneer</span>
: - <span style="color:#00c832;">Dartling Gunner</span>
: - <span style="color:#f0a050;">Spike Factory</span>
: - <span style="color:#f0a050;">Banana Farm</span>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
:: I've always loved the Tack Shooter. I think it's because it looked really... symmetrical and clean in 2D in BTD5. It's also quite good in-game, with some cheap early game popping power and powerful Tier V upgrades.

:: The Monkey Sub's just really powerful. Its Advanced Intel upgrade is probably one of the most useful upgrades in the entire game. All 3 of its paths are amazing - Bloontonium Reactor completely wastes away bloons, Pre-Emptive Strike helps hugely during DDT rushes and is extremely effective when paired with a Sub Commander, which, well... yeah, it's crazily OP.

:: I love the Monkey Buccaneer so much that I <s>made a game</s> am planning to make a game inspired by it. Yup, just from one monkey. So firstly, 'Buccaneer' is really satisfying to say, cuz of the 'k' sound, which is imo the most satisfying sound to say. It's also got a ton of popping power (Double Shot + Grape Shot) and tons of references to irl stuff (Double Shot, Grape Shot, Crow's Nest, etc), which I absolutely love. And the artwork and upgrade icons are amazing. And it's a water monkey, which makes it even more special and unique. Overall, definitely a serious contender for my all-time favourite monkey.

:: Everyone loves the Dartling Gunner. Including me. I always used to spam it in BTD5, and still do in BTD6. Hydra Rocket Pods is super satisfying and powerful, and Ray of Doom is even crazier.

:: Banana Farm, Banana Farm, what would we do without Banana Farms... honestly it's one of the most important towers in the game, and makes those expensive Tier IV and V upgrades so much more viable. I like using the bottom path Farm, because it's just the easiest and simply generates income without me having to worry about much. While it is less efficient, it's much more convenient and management-free.

:: Back in BTD5, I thought the Spike Factory was really overpowered, because it dropped road spikes - which I loved using - for free. Well, it wasn't that OP, but still I absolutely loved using it. I adored its technical and symmetrical 2D design, and the excellent colour schemes and interesting upgrades.
</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Heroes </span> ===
In order:
: - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Admiral Brickell</span>
: - Adora
: - Quincy
:: <div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">Admiral Brickell is hard to explain. It's not to do with her power or usefulness, even though she is pretty powerful and useful. Adora fits perfectly with Ninja and Alchemist, so yeah, she's the hero I use most of the time. And Quincy's just classic.</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Bloons </span> ===
In order:
: - MOAB
: - Pink Bloon
: - Ceramic Bloon
:: <div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">Ahh, these will be quite hard to explain. I really like the shape and colour of the MOAB. The Easter Egg skin is also really nice. The Pink Bloon... I just like spamming it in Sandbox Mode. Idk why tbh. Maybe cuz it moves so fast and is relatively tough. And the Ceramic's popping sound is just so satisfying. Also it looks strong.</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Tracks </span> ===
So Cubism is definitely my favourite map, but there are a couple of others that I also really like:
<gallery>
MonkeyMeadow No UI.png | Monkey Meadow
FrozenOver No UI.png | Frozen Over
FourCircles No UI.png | Four Circles
Downstream No UI.png | Downstream
Rake No UI.png | Rake
</gallery>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
:: Monkey Meadow is just a really clean, nice and beautifully simple track, perfect for a starter track. Straights, curves, loops, it's got 'em all. I also like how water and line of sight aren't in this map, and instead are gradually introduced to us in the later tracks, just to make new players feel more at ease. Nice map for Sandbox too.

:: There's something just really nice about Frozen Over. I love the colours, the water in the middle, the unique look of the path, but there's something else I can't quite put my finger on that makes me like this track so much. Winter Nights is also a plus, since it's my favourite soundtrack.

:: Four Circles is one of my favourite tracks to play in Sandbox, because it's symmetrical and has 2 huge loops for radial monkeys, as well as an amazing central spot for your main defence or True Sun God. Also Aces with 'Figure 8' flight path line up almost perfectly with the track, which both looks nice and maximizes damage.

:: Downstream is essentially Monkey Meadow but with water. At least that's how I see it. I love the terrain and the trees, and the pebbles and water, and the stream running right through the centre. It's kind of similar to Park Path, which I guess is cool (well Park Path was added to BTD6, but still cool). It's just a very pleasant map that's enjoyable to play on.

:: Ihdky I love Rake so much, but I would definitely say it's my second favourite map. It just looks... nice. It's clean, I guess, with a cool path texture, and has water. Also, really random, but the mixture of straight lines but curved edges reminds me of the first font I ever downloaded - RAJDHANI, the font used in the Asphalt 9. So I guess it also has some sentimental value. Idk.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Soundtracks </span> ===
In order:
: - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Winter Nights</span>
: - <span style="color:#a050f0;">Tribes and Tribulations - Funked Up Mix</span>
: - Party Time
:: <div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">Winter Nights is my absolute favourite. I love the drop. Nothing else to say, really. Tribes & Tribulations Funked Up is, well, funky, and Party Time's, like Quincy, just classic.</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Powers </span> ===
: - Cash Drop
: - Banana Farmer
: - Road Spikes
:: <div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">I love the Cash Drop icon. Weird, ik, but I love admiring BTD6's art. Banana Farmer is very useful, but I mostly use Marketplaces so I don't use him much. And Road Spikes is useful if you forget to get Camo or Lead or CAMOLED (that's how you spell it, definitely) popping power. Also it was in Bloons TD5, so... that's cool I guess.</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Tier V Upgrades </span> ===
: Boomerang Monkey - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Glaive Lord</span>
: Tack Shooter - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">The Tack Zone</span>
: Monkey Ace - <span style="color:#00c832;">Flying Fortress</span>
: Dartling Gunner - <span style="color:#00c832;">Ray of Doom</span>
: Wizard Monkey - <span style="color:#a050f0;">Prince of Darkness</span>
: Spike Factory - <span style="color:#f0a050;">Perma-Spike</span>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
:: Although it isn't particularly powerful late-game, the Glaive Lord is still extremely fun and satisfying to play around with in Sandbox. If you place it around a good curve or loop, it completely annihilates any bloon (except maybe fortified Super Ceramics) that comes along. Also, you can make it even stronger with Primary Mentoring.

:: The Tack Zone is a super versatile tower and extremely powerful against everything. It shoots a TON of projectiles, which makes it great for both damaging Bloons and MOABs. Unfortunately as of 25.0 it doesn't pop Leads anymore, but you'll alch-buff it anyway so that doesn't really matter, and now it's SUPER cheap for a Tier V. And, just like the Glaive Lord, you can power it up even more with Primary Mentoring.

:: Flying Fortress. Just say it. Say it to yourself out loud. It sounds SO COOL. Plus, it's a reference to the irl Boeing Flying Fortress, which to me makes it even cooler. I love the references to irl stuff in BTD. Nuff said. Who cares if it's super expensive and underpowered.

:: Ray of Doom was my favourite upgrade in BTD5, and in BTD6 it's even crazier. I'm not that big of a fan of the giant seat thingy, but regardless it does look pretty menacing. The added Lazer Shock effect fits really nicely, and the flickering electricity at the base of the ray adds to the coolness. Infinite pierce is also cool.

:: Prince of Darkness is a very creative and unique upgrade, not quite like anything I've ever seen before. It's pretty cheap for a Tier V upgrade, and is awesome for cleanup, AND you can crosspath it with Wall of Fire for even more damage. Overall, a fitting new Tier V upgrade for the Wizard Monkey.

:: Perma-Spike will always be the best safety net of all time, and always my 'strategy' for beating CHIMPS. It's honestly so overpowered, and I love it. Cool name too.
</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Tier IV Upgrades </span> ===
: Dart Monkey - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Sharp Shooter</span>
: Sniper Monkey - <span style="color:#00c832;">Full Auto Rifle</span>
: Mortar Monkey - <span style="color:#00c832;">Shattering Shells</span>
: Dartling Gunner - <span style="color:#00c832;">Plasma Accelerator</span>
: Ninja Monkey - <span style="color:#a050f0;">Bloonjitsu</span>
: Alchemist - <span style="color:#a050f0;">Stronger Stimulant</span>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
:: I don't think any upgrade would've suited the Dart Monkey more as a 3rd upgrade path than the crossbow. It just makes so much sense. It's a very versatile upgrade path, and also has good stepping stones - the jump from each upgrade to the next isn't that huge. Anyway, the Sharp Shooter is extremely useful for taking down the MOAB on Round 40, and it's always my go-to option for MOAB damage early on. Those Crit shots deal a lot of damage.

:: The Full Auto Rifle is so extremely versatile. It can detect Camo (Night Vision Goggles), pop Lead, and therefore CAMOLED (next generation of the AMOLED right there), has extremely high firerate, deals good damage against MOABs and grouped bloons (Shrapnel Shot), and has global range. Ridiculous.

:: Idk what I was doing before I started using Shattering Shells. Seriously. This is an absolute MUST for late game (I mean Round 80+, and especially Round 100+). Removing fortifications off BFBs!? It saves you SO much time and effort trying to deal enough damage, and makes rounds like 98 a breeze. Pretty affordable too.

:: Plasma Accelerator... sounds cool. Idc if it's not that powerful, it just sounds awesome.

:: Bloonjitsu and Stronger Stimulant, one of the most powerful and versatile combos... ever. Has great stepping stones and doesn't cost a crazy amount of cash. A lot of popping power for both mid and late game. Can pop Camo, Lead, grouped bloons, MOABs, yeah. Definitely my most used combo.
</div>

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Favourite Tier III Upgrades </span> ===
: Dart Monkey - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Spike-o-Pult</span>
: Tack Shooter - <span style="color:#50a0f0;">Tack Sprayer</span>
: Monkey Buccaneer - <span style="color:#00c832;">Destroyer</span>
: Monkey Ace - <span style="color:#00c832;">Neva-Miss Targeting</span>
: Dartling Gunner - <span style="color:#00c832;">Hydra Rocket Pods</span>
: Wizard Monkey - <span style="color:#a050f0;">Arcane Mastery</span>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
:: Spike-o-Pult might be a rather strange choice, but I personally really enjoy using it. It's super cheap and is great for dealing with a long line of bloons. While it doesn't have the greatest DPS, it can weaken an entire line of bloons and slow them all down, allowing your other towers to take them down with ease. (Also don't kill me, but I like using a 3-0-2 Spike-o-Pult)

:: One of my favourite towers for early game, the 2-0-3 Tack Sprayer. So much cheap popping power. I still think it looked cooler in BTD5 where it was 2D though.

:: Firstly, say Destroyer out loud. It just sounds powerful. Furthermore, it's got a lot of popping power (if you get Grape Shot) and leads to very good Tier IV and V upgrades.

:: Neva-Miss Targeting is just such a useful upgrade. The fact that the darts can home in on bloons hugely increases the Ace's popping power. It's perfect for tracks with a lot of obstacles, like Ravine or High Finance. Also it's extremely satisfying watching all those darts fly around on screen.

:: Hydra Rocket Pods is definitely one of the most satisfying upgrades in the game. It looks so much better than in BTD5, with its nuclear green look and numerous explosions. Honestly, I could watch those explosions all day. Plus, it's extremely powerful and has a ton of popping power.

:: Idk how an upgrade ''itself'' (and not the name or how it attacks) can be ''satisfying'', but Arcane Mastery somehow is. Like, the HUGELY increased range is just... satisfying. Weird, ik, but I like it. Plus it gives a bunch of other nice upgrades like attack speed and pierce, and overall has a lot of popping power all for a relatively low price.

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
: Crossbow Master's is exactly what Tier V upgrade art should be - awesome, menacing and from a cool angle. I love how it changes drastically from Tier IV to V, really emphasizing the sheer power of the Tier V upgrade.

: I love Inferno Ring's upgrade art for the same reasons as the Crossbow Master. It's just so cool and ferocious. It really lives up to its description (''roasts bloons into oblivion''). That definitely looks super hot and deadly.

: The upgrade art for Razor Rotors is actually what my Heli Pilot's name (Yaaaaaaa) was inspired by. If he had an open mouth, you would be able to just imagine him shouting ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Chaaaaaarge!<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' That grin's still pretty nice tho.

: The MAD is just so, so menacing and powerful. Absolutely ridiculous.

: Archmage reminds me of Vitruvius from the LEGO Movie, which I guess is cool. But other than that I also love the orb of energy in his hand, makes him look super magical and powerful.

: Grandmaster Ninja... what can I say. Yet another epitome of amazing Tier V upgrade art. I love it.

: Ultra-Juggernaut's upgrade icon is... smooth, is the only word I can think of to describe it. The spiked ball looks incredibly clean and the gradient lines from orange to yellow almost make it seem like it's glowing. Yeah. Pretty cool.

: I absolutely love the shape of MOAB Assassin's icon. It's so sleek and angular (I'm aware this sounds like I'm describing a car here) and the sparkle is so... perfect.

: Super Maelstrom looks, sounds and is cool. That's pretty much all.

: I absolutely adore the super-smooth MOAB art in the Shattering Shells icon, which also fits really nicely with the style of the shattered fortifications. It's so satisfying to look at.

: Necromancer's upgrade icon is one of the most unique and well thought-out upgrade icons (imo). It's simple yet beautiful and perfectly represents what the upgrade does. I love the addition of the skull on the Zombie Bloon, which isn't actually on the Zombie Bloons Or maybe we're just looking from the wrong angle...? but makes it so much more representative and interesting.

: Sprockets... bit of a random one, ig, but it's just... nice, ig.

|-|Bloons=
=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Orange Bloon </span> ===
Immune to fire. (If this bloon were to be added, then the Purple bloon would no longer be immune to fire, and instead only immune to magic - because fire clearly isn't magic) Releases 3 Yellow bloons when popped.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Glass Bloon </span> ===
Can only be popped by sharp or explosive attacks.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Marble Bloon </span> ===
Similar to the Ceramic bloon, this bloon takes multiple hits to pop (12), but also has RESISTANCE which means it takes -1 damage from all attacks. Therefore, only attacks that deal multiple layers of damage can pop it.

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Invisi-Bloon </span> ===
Is invisible to all monkeys who do not have innate camo detection (so 0-2-0 Village doesn't allow monkeys to attack it).

=== <span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Noto Sans', 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;"> Volcano Bloon </span> ===
Came up with this the other day but forgot what it was supposed to do.

I was once an editor for the Monkeyopolis Times, a newspaper all about the latest events in Monkeyopolis!

I first came across their Interview with Quincy video, but the first edition I ever read was the [https://reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/n4v456/monkeyopolis_times_27th_edition/ 27th Edition], on the day I officially joined reddit (I had been browsing r/btd6 for a long time - that's how I came across the Interview - but never properly created an account). Originally I didn't intend to really contribute or anything, just wanted to enjoy the newspaper, but then I made an ad, and then an article, and then I just kinda got into it, and eventually, a little bit after the release of the [https://reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/nkspvm/monkeyopolis_times_30th_edition/ 30th Edition], I became an editor. The first edition I helped create was the [https://reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/nq3z9x/the_monkeyopolis_times_31st_edition/ 31st Edition].

Unfortunately, now I've officially retired.
