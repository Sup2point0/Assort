# The Monkeyopolis Times

*The Monkeyopolis Times* was a fictional newspaper for Bloons TD 6, which I helped to run for over half a year.

## The Journey

### Discovery
I first came across the Monkeyopolis Times on the day I created my reddit account – 4th May 2021 – while browsing [r/btd6](https://reddit.com/r/btd6). Call it sheer luck, I suppose. I make no exaggeration when I say, I fell in love immediately. This is *exactly* the sort of thing I live for. I left a single comment, saying ‘this is amazing!’ and joined the Discord server.
