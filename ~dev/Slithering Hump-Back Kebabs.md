It’s said there are only 2 hard things in race conditions, computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. While I have yet to encounter `NullPointerException` in my programming excursions, the latter still confuzzles my 2.0 brain cells every now and then, and I very much hope I never have to deal with the living nightmare of debugging a multithreaded system, above all it’s that one – *naming things* – that I feel most painfully.

Ayo, lemme translate that for you, since that sentence looks like a mangled piece of *very* legacy code from the noughties. There are 4 hard things: race conditions, cache invalidation, namings things, and off-by-one errors. I have yet to encounter the first 2. The last happens all the time. And naming things? You have no idea. Day in, day out. It’s just what I do.

Naming things is a topic for another time. Here I want to talk about casing – that is, how the parts of a name (words, generally) are capitalised.

> Y’know what’s even better than kebab-case? `dot.notation`. As in, `python.s.order`. Unfortunately, this isn’t always applicable, and can also quickly get out of hand with too much nesting.
