Being a software developer is tough. So, if you’re ever in a pickle, and hopefully not one to do with pickling, here are some suggestions to help you fix the issue.

1. ***Fix by feature.*** It’s a feature, not a bug.
1. ***Fix by coffee break.*** But sir, the code’s compiling...
1. ***Fix by force.*** Have you tried turning it off and on again?
1. ***Fix by deployment.*** Well, it worked on *my* machine...
1. ***Fix by forgetfulness.*** Wait, what bug were we talking about?
1. ***Fix by accuracy.*** If it won’t pass the tests, the tests won’t parse it. Can’t fail the tests if there are no tests.
1. ***Fix by deprecation.*** Just get an RTX 5090, bruh.
1. ***Fix by time travel.*** We’ll delegate this problem to future me, sounds good.
1. ***Fix by blame.*** This is clearly a bug in the library, not my problem.
1. ***Fix by extrapolation.*** If it works for this input, it must work for any input.
1. ***Fix by paywall.*** If they have to pay to access this, then no one will realise it’s broken.
1. ***Fix by fantasy.*** Wouldn’t it be nice if this bug were fixed?
1. ***Fix by firewall.*** I wonder why all those complaint tickets stopped?
1. ***Fix by mathematics.*** By my calculations, this bug is unfixable.
1. ***Fix by futility.*** Repairing this code would take far too long...
1. ***Fix by JavaScript.*** These frameworks suck, what if we just created our own?
1. ***Fix by commit.*** If the commit message says it’s fixed, it must be fixed.
1. ***Fix by adverts.*** Cover the broken content with endorsed NSFW advertisements.
1. ***Fix by homogeneity.*** If none of the code works, then none of it’s broken.
1. ***Fix by NullPointerException.*** `sudo rm -rf`
1. ***Fix by merge conflict.*** There must be *some* combination of code in there that works.
1. ***Fix by threading.*** What if we used multithreading to speed up the code?
1. ***Fix by virus.*** If we infect the software with a virus, then they won’t be able to tell it’s broken.
1. ***Fix by inheritance.*** This problem was inherited from another class, so it’s outside our scope.
1. ***Fix by stack.*** Have you tried making it serverless?
1. ***Fix by facade.*** If we just show them a video of it doing the right thing, we can avoid actually coding anything.
1. ***Fix by fable.*** There was once a monk...
1. ***Fix by pay2win.*** Just pay someone else to fix it for us.
1. ***Fix by duct tape.*** There’s nothing duct tape and a screwdriver can’t solve.
1. ***Fix by frontend.*** If the user can’t navigate this annoying UI, they won’t find any bugs.
1. ***Fix by code review.*** We have 69420 5-star reviews on the App Store, so it must be good!
1. ***Fix by catch.*** `except Exception: pass`
1. ***Fix by encapsulation.*** As long as we wrap all this spaghetti code in a class with one method, we’ll be good to go.
1. ***Fix by dogma.*** Sorry, dog ate my code.
1. ***Fix by open-source.*** Someone will open a pull request eventually, right?
1. ***Fix by statistics.*** This bug is negligible at the 50% significance level, so we reject its existence.
1. ***Fix by startup.*** Hey, founding a startup sounds like a good idea!
1. ***Fix by failure.*** Failure is the true path to success.
1. ***Proof by denial.*** Our program is perfect.
1. ***Fix by duck-talking.*** Moan about the issue to the duck, and it’ll magically resolve itself. Trust.
1. ***Fix by artificial intelligence.*** Have you tried adding AI to it?
1. ***Fix by definition.*** `#PRAGMA fixed=true;`
