Programming, I love you.  
I’ve loved you since the day I Scratched your surface  
Messy and mathsy, but perfectly imperfect,  
So moody, so temperamental, you’re such a little cutie  
I could go on for days about your polymorphic beauty.  
Seriously, it’s not just a phase.  
There’s nothing in this world that could erase  
My love for you; it lights me up within,  
More stable than an aromatic ring.  
Of all my loves, it’s you who was my first  
Brain-fried and bleary-eyed, you’ve seen me at my worst.  
You have shattered me, unravelled me, set fire to this heart  
And wherever life may take us, I hope we never part.
