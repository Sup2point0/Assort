# What Was This Called Again?
<!-- #QUARK live! -->

Ah. It’s here again –  
Just there, you know,  
If you tried you could touch upon it then  
it flits away, and no –  
It’s gone, no trace,  
And even then you fervently give chase;  
Until, dismayed,  
You turn and look away.  
You’re sure it will arise another day.  
A tickle in the confines of your mind,  
A sense of something that you’ve left behind.
