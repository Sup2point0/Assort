Surprisingly, I genuinely enjoy writing poetry.

In fact, there was one time where I even chose writing poetry over browsing Wikipedia. Shocking, I know.

Oh yeah, and yeah no, I’m aware half of them don’t make any sense at all, and I have no idea what I was thinking while writing them. Probably just lamenting for some random stuff.
