If I were to describe maths, it would be as a fractal.  
You start so simple, so real, so pure  
Even 2-year-old me could do it without much thought  
But look closer, and in there lies beauty  
Mathematical marvels and truths so juicy  
An endless world of fascination  
Complex beyond imagination  
Perfectly functioning  
Through generations of discovery  
The infrastructure of all that exists  
Lying under your fingertips  
Deeper you dive, specialising more  
Falling in love with calculus lore  
Quaternions! Tensors! Parallelopipeds!  
Name an obscure field and we’ll find it  
Geometricise your algebra into algebraic geometry  
And lose yourself in quantum topology  
The world of maths is n-dimensional  
Where n is an integer infinitely extensible  
Axioms, conjectures, identities and lemmas  
Eternal inequalities with S-I+G-N errors  
Here we don’t approximate pi as 3  
And exp(x) is its own integral + c  
Screw it, \*convolutes your convolutions*  
This area is too small to fit these solutions  
So in this year’s maths society, now it’s our turn  
To share all the stuff and guff that we’ve learnt  
And lose ourselves til we go insane  
In the uncountable infinity of the mathematical domain.
