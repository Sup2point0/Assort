There comes a moment in everyone’s mind  
When you look back and see all that is past,  
Reflect on memories and different times  
And feel like they’re slipping out of your grasp;  

Those blissful days of naive hopes and dreams,  
Unknowingly creating precious  
memories to last for years;  
Not all that long ago it sometimes seems,  
It’s almost like just yesterday  
That we were standing just right here.  

Often the past seems better than the now  
The good ol’ days when everything was pure,  
Without everything to worry about  
And the novel facet still held allure;  

With desperation swim against the tide,  
Like aves struggling to lift, strained down  
by damp wings tangled in a net;  
It’s that funny feeling you get inside,  
Helpless, drowning, unreal, gone  
They told you that your path was set.  

Perhaps this is just simply how we are,  
And even the closest of echoes can feel far.
