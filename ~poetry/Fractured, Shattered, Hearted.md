Across this chasm I watch,  
Unwavering, observing.  
Perhaps you do not see my ache to cross  
Yet nothing that I do can quell this yearning.  

What can I do except admire  
The innate allure of your light,  
I feel it reach me, a swimming fire  
Of sparks that breathe my heart to life.  

You draw me in, why do you draw me in,  
I’m miserably helpless to resist.  
Even as you drift away I cling  
Onto the hope this time, it might persist.  

But you and I are not alike, too well am I aware  
That we do dwell in different realms,  
I know not why so much I care  
For a wall only I see between ourselves.  

Therein lies my undoing.  
Creature in my head!  
How you unravel me, my thoughts you ruin;  
Cracks I thought were mended split again,  

Fear, jealousy, worry, hurt,  
It’s crushing me from within.  
Relentless, inevitable, their gravity a curse,  
And what if I were to give in?  

So lost, so lost are we,  
Stranded between the dark and light.  
These scars too burnt to ever heal  
Yet still we keep obscured from sight.  

My mind you have undone,  
My blood solidified to ice;  
Maybe our solace is not found as one,  
And fragments united can suffice.  

This fractured heart that curls away inside  
Has long since shattered, ad infinitum dividing,  
Until amidst this silent darkness hides  
Mournful echoes of a lost soul crying.
