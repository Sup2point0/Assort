Look up, a skies untouched,  
Leave nothing if for a careless blink;  
There will never be enough.  
They said sever the link;  
When will you be ready?  

Reach out, and see the sight,  
That lingers between the halo;  
One will have to demise,  
for the other to rise.  
Are you truly ok though?  

A curve I think not, to learn,  
Hold to those vows;  
Capability confirm,  
Provided you turn.  
Never forget;  
Our time is now.
