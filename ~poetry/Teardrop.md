# Teardrop
<!-- #QUARK live! -->

Look up, a sky of gleaming stalactites  
of ice, streaming down from heavens above;  
Those nonexistent memorys ignite,  
sparked by the glow of one lonely snowdove.  
How otherworldly does it feel, to rake  
your frozen fingers through the natural earth;  
A trail of disturbance in their wake,  
Eyes flutter closed, a laugh escaped in mirth.  
At peace for once, you wonder to before  
how lucky to stumble upon this find;  
If only you could stay forevermore,  
Alas, this is the last cave of its kind.  
Never forget, here lies, a time long-lost,  
The Ancientsâ€™ home should never have been crossed.
