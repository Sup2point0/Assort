# Heartburn
<!-- #QUARK live! -->

There are few feelings worse than burnout.  
When your heart once filled with wonder and delight  
Now lies extinguished, ephemerally alight;  
Hands frozen dry, ears closed, eyes dim  
Before you even knew the cold seeped in.  
You drift, wander, living on sparks  
To burn you inside until you’re scarred.  
When there was no dark you thought the light would never run out  
But now night falls and you see the shadows of doubt.  
What happened to being driven?  
What happened to having love?  
You don’t train for the shots you’re given  
And won’t get up without a nudge.  
As *if* more time will erase the stains  
Of stagnation, complacence which still remain;  
Regret, remorse, relapse, you’ve utterly cursed  
yourself with everything, everywhere and so much worse;  
Your hear those whispers in the dark of your mind.  
Perhaps for the first time in your life  
You are understanding what it means to feel fear.  
Now the bubble has burst and I can hear  
The looming weight of the world,  
Eternally above  
And it’s soul-crushing  
Mind-tearing,  
Heart-burning.  
When did we grow up?
