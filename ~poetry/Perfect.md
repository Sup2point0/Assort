# Perfect

Quasi-sarcastive ironicity,  
Lopsided eyes of shining intellect,  
Shared loves, interests, affinitys,  
How in xenique can he be so perfect.  
No one has ever warmed my heart like so,  
Indulged my quirks, looked past my flaws,  
When I’m with him I can pour out my soul,  
He’s everything a friend could be and more.  
I think by now I’ve truly given in,  
No matter who else I find in the world,  
Could never understand me quite like him,  
If only in some life he were a girl.  
Why should I open up to someone new?  
Should lower my expectations a few.
