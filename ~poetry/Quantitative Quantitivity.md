Quantity is rough.  
How do these people write so much  
in such  
a tiny space of time  
Their minds  
must be ever taut  
with unrelenting thought  
to continue, press on, drive  
ahead, their fingers fly and strive  
to write  
and right! It’s right,  
all stuff of value,  
mildly waffle, sure, but indeed all true  
Perhaps unsophisticated and verbose  
and overly developed prose  
No commas, punctuation  
and way too complex sentence construction,  
Yet comprehensive,  
certainly extensive,  
Covering all that needs to be said,  
while coming across as very well read,  
And even if that may not be the case  
it’s them who win the race  
I think, at least,  
or maybe my prowess has just decreased  
and I’m delusional  
My mind has gone diagonal  
They say don’t sell  
yourself short, but well  
I just can’t write, or speak,  
or read, or leak  
ideas that quick  
or think  
ahead by 20 paragraphs  
If only I could write just half  
as fast as I could type  
then life  
would suck less  
Ah, this is a mess.
