# Quantitative Quantitivity

Quantity is rough.  
How do these people write so much  
in such  
a tiny space of time  
Their minds  
must be ever taut  
with unrelenting thought  
to continue, press on, drive  
ahead, their fingers fly and strive  
to write  
and right! Itâ€™s right,  
all stuff of value,  
mildly waffle, sure, but indeed all true,  
perhaps unsophisticated and verbose  
and overly developed prose  
no commas, punctuation  
and way too complex sentence construction  
yet comprehensive,  
certainly extensive,  
Covering all that needs to be said,  
while coming across as very well read,  
and even if that may not be the case...
