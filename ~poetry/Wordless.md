How do we start this one?  
Or what if this had no structure  
or form  
or rhyme  
or flow  
But we just  
let it be.  
This is no masterpiece, I’m sure  
But perhaps it’s something more  
When the rhyming couplets come naturally  
And we don’t go back and edit,  
Whatever’s written stays written.  
Like traditional pen-and-paper  
Simpler.  
There is less thought into this, no doubt  
But there is more thought it here, *all* thoughts  
Whatever comes to mind ~ down  
And imperfections might linger  
if only to remind a future descendant of prior gaps  
Maybe they’ll be the one to fill it.  
Are these even filled with deeper meaning?  
Why do I write them?  
An escape  
A medium  
for expression, if I even needed that  
Every wackoff piece like this  
dilutes the purity of this directory  
yet  
who cares.  
I care, but –  
maybe this is what I need.  
How can I have so many thoughts  
cataclysmically reverberating within this space  
Demanding to be voiced and recorded  
Recced and docced, as I now say  
so much thought  
for meaning beyond  
This barely classes as a poem.  
We shall leave it as a footnote.  
One final rhyming couplet, tick–  
That ought to do the trick.
