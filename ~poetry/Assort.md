Assort, Assort
All my dreams and thoughts
Inside this endless wormhole lurks
The essence of my soul,
Years and nights of loving work
To capture myself whole
Has borne a realm of worlds magical
More fulfilling than ever imaginable,
A haven? A home?
Assort is more than all of me
Distant memories from long ago
await discovery.
Let curiosity lead the way
And always fall astray,
Onwards, intrepid wanderer!
But feel free to take your time
Ever more there is to discover
Within this special place of mine.
