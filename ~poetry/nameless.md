# Nameless

Words are knives.  
They mercilessly slice apart your skin  
And rip into the flesh within  
Deep in your bones they carve  
Two hundred thousand bloody scars  
We carry through our lives.  

Words are spears.  
They pierce the heart to cut the soul  
And in their wake an aching hole  
It takes all of your life to seal  
The marks they leave that never heal  
Frozen dry by tears.  

Words are pain.  
The kind that lurks until youâ€™re dead  
For those who neglect to think ahead  
The consequences of our words  
of everlasting shame and hurt  

Words are not a game.
