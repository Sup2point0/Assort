Let’s say that you’ve written a poem or song  
But now all it needs is a name  
It’s overly vague and incredibly long  
So naming it right will be pain  

It needs to accomplish so much in so little  
But anything really would work  
Intriguing, confusing or meaningless drivel  
A random irrelevant word  

There’s plenty of obvious options to try  
But they’re a bit boring and plain  
A search engine keyword or memorable line  
A shortened form of the refrain  

Perhaps you would want it to hold some mystique  
To snatch an adventurer’s glance  
A sequence of words unheard and unique  
Hammered together by chance  

Something to set it apart from the rest  
But capture the essence within  
Another perspective you wouldn’t have guessed  
A title you just can’t resist  

But even with so many choices of words  
It’s like they’ve already been used  
A single word title, the eternal curse  
Perhaps we just need something new  

Well I have no clue what this one will be called  
So that it’s not all just the same  
It better be something that’s edgy or cool  
But really, it’s only a name.
