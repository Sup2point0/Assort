# Time of the Times

A year ago, or just a little more  
It seems like a completely different world  
Created by Vitrux, the Times was born  
Hard to believe that it’s now one year old  
Four different accounts, four eras past  
Four dozen editions, and then some  
Generations of editors and staff  
It’s crazy to see just how far we’ve come  
So now has come the time to celebrate  
For what a wondrous journey this has been  
Although it’s just a tiny bit late  
Let’s all shout ‘Happy Anniversary!’  
And now that we’ve made it through a whole year  
Here’s to one more, let’s hope the end isn’t too near
